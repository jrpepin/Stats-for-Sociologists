# Tutorials

## all:

-   change practice call to css workflow
-   change to use {.sparse-slide} for lectures 1-3
-   change pngs to table and ggplots where possible
-   integrate R code into tutorials
-   all have practice questions
-   consistent (not?) allow-retry for Learning Checks
-   update all examples where possible

## 03

-   can't make allow_skip: false because exercise in `median` section
    doesn't evaluate as being completed.

## 04

-   add in R code exercises?
-   re-do many equations/tables/figures in R without png

# Lectures

-   change from callout tip workflow to css for clearer syntax

-   run all lectures through stylr for consistent grammer

## 03

-   Add slides [like
    these](https://sta199-f24.github.io/slides/05-exploring-data-II-slides.html#/group_by-summarize-count).

-   add step-by-step instructions in code-along for dplyr verbs

-   move `select()` to Data Management II because it's about changing
    dataframes, not variables.

# Memos
