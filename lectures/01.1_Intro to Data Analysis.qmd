## Unit of Analysis

::: {style="color: #e74c3c; font-size: 150%; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}
Who or what is being studied?
:::

<br>  

::: callout-tip
# POPULATION

All units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the
researcher is interested.
:::

<br>

::: callout-tip
# SAMPLE

A subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a
population.
:::

## Notation

[**N**]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to
**population** size

<br>

[***n***]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to **sample**
size

##  {#slide4-id data-menu-title="Descriptive vs Inferential"}

::: callout-tip
## DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Procedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a
sample or population.
:::

<br>

::: callout-tip
## INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

Making underlying predictions or inferences about a population using
observations and analyses from a sample.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS - Procedures that help us organize and describe
data collected from a sample or population. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS -

## Tidy Data

Any factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or
types.

## Measurement Levels {#slide8-id}

:::: r-stack
::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
[**Nominal**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}\
A variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered

[**Ordinal**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}\
A variable made up of ranked categories, with no systematic or
measurable numeric difference between the categories.

[**Interval-ratio** (aka continuous)]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}\
A variable with categories that are ordered and expressed in the same
units.

[**Dichotomous** (aka binary)]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}\
A variable with only two categories.
