# Learning to Code {.theme-section}

## Technology is fun!

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 90%"}
You're not just learning the statistical concepts in this course, but
how to produce the statistics. Analyzing data requires learning to use
new technology.

<br>

Learning statistical software to analyze data can be really fun. You get
to learn about real world social problems!
:::

## Technology is challenging!

:::: r-stack
::: {style="font-size: 90%"}
It can be frustrating.

<br>

When it feels like the technology is preventing you from getting to the
course content, take a deep breath, and **remember that building your
technology skills is part of this course.**
:::

![](images/01/bingo.png){.fragment fragment-index="1" width="85%"}
::::

::: notes
Replication using technology requires researchers to sometimes use
unfamiliar software, working on devices with unique environments and
settings.

There's even a bingo card of common errors (i.e. bugs) that new
statistical programmers will expect to experience.
:::

## Why am I making you learn something so frustrating?

<br>

Calculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time
consuming, and difficult.

<br>

Good social science is built on replication.

::: notes
You'll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to
really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s,
1,000s, even 100,000s of values.

It is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate
research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch
minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers,
inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data.
:::

## Grappling

Learning to use statistical software necessitates
[grappling](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/4-tips-teaching-problem-solving-from-student-anna-pelletiere).

::: {style="color: #18BC9C; font-size: 90%; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}
Grappling implies trying even before you fail the first time.

<br>

It‚Äôs thinking, ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôll work with it independently. Okay, I‚Äôm really
not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved
for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got
the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.‚Äù

<br>

Grappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully,
and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.‚Äù
:::

::: notes
In this course, this means you'll put your active learning skills to
use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered
problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the
entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as
you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets
increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the
errors stack-up.
:::

##  {data-menu-title="Debugging"}

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="25%"}
::: {style="font-size: 95%; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}
Most statistical analyses happen not because the person is a math
genius, but because they persisted through the minefield of technical
issues by being [**excellent problem-solvers.**]{style="color: #18BC9C"}
:::
::::

::: {.column width="75%"}
![](images/01/debugging.png)
:::
::::::

::: notes
Get comfortable with making mistakes right now. Your code is not
expected to be perfect the first time. Remember, identifying and fixing
errors in your own code is such an inherent part of the process, there's
even a name for it: **debugging**.
:::

## Coding is mostly Googling

<br>

It is a misconception that the best statistical analysts sit down at
their computers and type code from memory.

<br>

Much of the process of coding is copying code from somewhere else and
modifying it to fit your particular situation.

::: notes
Learning to analyze data with software requires a lot of practice and
attention to detail. It also requires a lot of time searching the
internet for help. Learning to identify the right words and phrases in a
Google search is part of building your coding skills.
:::

## When you get stuck...

[**...there are many options to get unstuck:**]{style="color: #18BC9C"}

::: {style="font-size: 70%"}
-   Review the slides. Pay very close attention to small details.
-   Try something else to see if you get a new error.
-   Use Google to search for possible answers or new explanations.
-   Watch a help video on YouTube on the topic.
-   Re-start your web-browser or device.
-   Try another web-browser or device.
-   Ask a peer. Or an advanced student.
-   Start or join a weekly study group.
-   Post the question on the class discussion board.
-   Email your TA
:::

::: notes
When none of these strategies fix the issue, it is time to ask for help.
:::

## Help in this class

[**Before requesting an individual meeting with a
TA:**]{style="color: #E74C3C"}

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}
-   Spend a sufficient amount of time working on it on your own.
-   Ask two of your peers.
-   Post the question on the class discussion board.
:::

[**When emailing:**]{style="color: #E74C3C"}

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}
-   Explain what troubleshooting steps you‚Äôve already taken.
-   Report who you‚Äôve already asked for help.
:::

::: notes
If none of these solve your problem, draft an email to your TA, with
detailed notes about the problem and the troubleshooting steps you've
already taken. You might be surprised how often even writing the problem
out in detail helps you find the answer on your own. Send your email if
you still need assistance.
:::

## Create a trail! {data-menu-title="Help & Replication"}

![](images/01/repro_ex.png "Loneliness on internet without an answer to a coding question")

::: notes
Use replication principles when asking for help. The best quantitative
researchers produce a trail for their code so that future researchers
can replicate their analysis.
:::

## Create a reproducible example

<br>

::: {style="color: #18BC9C; font-size: 150%; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}
**Goal: Make someone else feel your pain!**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
-   Assume others know nothing about your issue.¬†
-   Describe your steps to create the problem so that someone else can
    replicate it.¬†
-   This means clearly describing the issue and the steps you've already
    taken to solve it.¬†
:::

## Good etiquette

**Search for answers before posting your question.**\
[Let me google that for you.
üôÑ]{style="color: #18BC9C; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}¬†

**Describe the problem.**\
["It doesn't work" isn't descriptive
enough.]{style="color: #18BC9C; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}¬†

**Describe your environment.**\
[What operating system are you using? Which R version? What packages?
Dataset?]{style="color: #18BC9C; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}\

**Describe the solution.**\
[Confirm if a solution offered works. Or, if you solve it on your own,
post how you solved
it.]{style="color: #18BC9C; font-family: 'Shadows Into Light'"}

##  {data-menu-title="Process Focused" background-image="images/01/debug-flow.png" background-size="contain"}

::: notes
Try to stay focused on being in the process, not the outcome.
