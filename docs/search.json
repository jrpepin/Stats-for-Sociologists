Homework assignments will include a mixture of conceptual and applied (computational) questions; in the latter case, directions will specify whether calculations should be done by hand or using R. Each homework will be weighted equally.\nAssignments are due by the beginning of class on the specified date. They should be uploaded to the designated spot on Quercus (NOT emailed to your professor or TA). Show your work, round numbers appropriately (when doing calculations retain at least four decimal places; when presenting your final answer, round to two decimal places), and be neat and organized.\nYou may work together in small groups on homework assignments. Remember, however, that working through the homework is the best preparation for the exam and a measure of your understanding of course material. Even if you work with others, you must write up and turn in your own homework."

Are there any other possible interpretations? What limitations might there be in your data or analysis that affect how well we can answer the question?\n\nDetails on the research brief, including choice of datasets, will be given at a later date.\nNOTE: To keep you on track and to provide feedback along the way, you will submit Table 01 (including your research question and data section) earlier in the semester (5%).

However, a due date for a milestone assignment can be extended for a legitimate reason with proper documentation (e.g., illness, family emergency, religious observance, accessibility accommodation) according to UofT’s guidelines. Late Research Briefs will be penalized at a rate of 2% per day up to 10% (5 days) and will not be accepted thereafter, except where there are legitimate, documented reasons beyond a student’s control. Flash Presentations, given their in class participatory nature, cannot be extended.\nNote: Extensions beyond the term end date (not the last day of instruction but the actual end of term, e.g., the last day of a fall term class may be December 1st, but the term ends December 23rd) requires a discussion with the instructor and the graduate office, as well as completion of an SGS request for an extension of course work form. These forms will be considered by the graduate office and are not automatically approved."

    "text": "Plagiarism Detection\nTurnitin plagiarism detection software is integrated within Quercus. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site. I am not comfortable with the widespread use of this software, which effectively provides large quantities of student work to a for-profit company whose future business uses may include using it to train machine learning and AI tools. Consequently, none of the assignments for this course are set for automatic review by Turnitin. However, if I have reason to suspect plagiarism, I may use this tool to detect plagiarism.\nIf you object to your work being subject to review by Turnitin, add a comment when you submit your assignment. If I do find that we need to review your assignment for plagiarism and you have asked that I not use Turnitin, I will ask that you provide sufficient secondary material (e.g., reading notes, outlines of the paper, rough drafts of the final draft, etc.) to establish that the paper you submit is truly yours. If you cannot or decline to provide the requested documentation and do not consent to us using Turnitin for review, I will decline to mark the assignment.\nPlagiarism: Be careful to avoid plagiarism. It is a serious academic offense with serious penalties (see the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters). Do not present someone else’s ideas as your own. Give proper references to others’ ideas, and use quotation marks if you are quoting. When in doubt, err on the side of a reference. Turning in an old paper, or large parts thereof, for credit in a second (or third etc.) course, is considered an academic offense that results in students being referred off to the Office of Academic Integrity."

I encourage you to limit your use to technical coding support/reference, grammar/copy editing, and outlining. Be aware that AI tools are often wrong, overly generic, and lacking in critical nuance. My expectations for you are considerably higher than that. You will need to be more persuasive and creative at linking sociological research with empirical data, thinking critically, and making connections between data and theory than any of these tools. Over-reliance on AI will prevent you from learning the skills necessary to complete work at the level expected for this class. Students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit."

    "text": "Why am I making you learn something so frustrating?\n\nCalculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult.\n\nGood social science is built on replication.\n\nYou’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nIt is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data."

Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\n\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up."

    "text": "Author Naomi Wolf wrote a book about the treatment of homosexuality in 19th century England. She reported that it was punishable by death since “sodomy” charges were followed by “death recorded” in the judicial logs. However, “sodomy” referred to a host of other sexual offenses, and “death recorded” specifically means they weren’t killed because their death was recorded but not carried out.\nPaul Dolan wrote a book about how marriage makes you miserable. A key part of his evidence was that in the American Time Use Survey, married people surveyed about their happiness when the spouse was present reported being happy, but when the spouse was absent they reported being unhappy. Covering up unhappiness in front of their spouse, truly miserable! But while Dolan read spouse present/absent as “spouse is in the room during questioning”, it actually meant “spouse together/separated.” He was comparing couples that were together vs. couples that were separating!"

It is strongly recommended that you re-try these practice questions until you have mastered the concepts.\nThe otter icon symbolizes playfulness, curiosity, and emotional intelligence. It’s a reminder to take a lighthearted approach to learning statistics.\nLet’s try it out.\n\n PRACTICE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt times, you may also be asked to practice interpretation of R output within the tutorials. The code will be pre-written for you and all you will have to do is click the ‘Run’ button to see the results.\nOther times, you will practice coding by revising existing code or manually typing in your own code to run. You can’t break the tutorial code. If you get an error message, press the ‘Start Over’ button and the code will automatically reset to the default.

Why do I have to learn about statistics?\nStudents often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. Watch this video for a summary of how sociologists do sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].\n\n\nBefore we can analyze data, we need to identify the unit of analysis: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.\nRarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.\n\nPOPULATION\nAll units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.\n\n\nSAMPLE\nA subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.\n\n\n\nA note on notation:\nN refers to population size\nn refers to sample size\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.\n\nCapital letters are typically used when describing a population. Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\nIn this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "text": "Learning to Code\n\nTechnology is fun!\nYou’re not just learning the statistical concepts in this course, but how to produce the statistics. Analyzing data requires learning to use new technology.\nLearning statistical software to analyze data can be really fun. You get to learn about real world social problems!\n\n\nTechnology is challenging!\nBut, it can also be frustrating. There’s even a bingo card of common errors (i.e. bugs) that new statistical programmers will expect to experience.\n\n\nWhy are you making me learn something so frustrating?\nOne reason is that calculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult. You’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nThe second reason to learn statistical software is because good social science is built on replication. It is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data.\nBut technology presents its own challenges. Replication using technology requires researchers to use sometimes unfamiliar software, working on devices with unique environments and settings.\nWhen it feels like the technology is preventing you from getting to the course content, take a deep breath, and remember that building your technology skills is part of this course.\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure\nA common misconception is that some people are just not math (or tech) people. This is a myth.\n\n“People’s belief that ‘math ability’ can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”\n\nConfidence and persistence likely have a larger role in math ability than genetics.\n\nIt is important to remain process oriented rather than product oriented. Instead of focusing on outcomes, such as external rewards (grades), focus on your learning process. How do you do that? One approach is to change your mindset.\nAdopting a “growth mindset” will help you get the most out of this course. A growth mindset is the belief that your skills and abilities can develop (through work and practice).\nAnother key to increasing your confidence is to expect failure. Failure is part of learning. When students are afraid of failing, it is harder for them to learn. But, research shows that students must occasionally fail, and even be frustrated at times, to really learn.\nGet comfortable with making mistakes right now. Failure is part of the learning process. Your job is to persist.\nYour code is not expected to be perfect the first time. Identifying and fixing errors in your own code is such an inherent part of the process, there’s even a name for it: debugging\n\n\n\n\nGrappling\nLearning to use statistical software necessitates grappling.\n\nGrappling implies trying even before you fail the first time.\nIt’s thinking, “First, I’ll work with it independently. Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up.\nIf you learn one thing in this course, I want you to walk away having better problem solving skills. This is because most statistical analyses happen not because the person is a math genius, but because they persisted through the minefield of technical issues by being excellent problem-solvers.\nCoding is mostly Googling\nIt is a misperception that the best statistical analysts sit down at their computers and type code from memory. In fact, much of process of coding is copying code from somewhere else and modifying it to fit your particular situation. There’s even a common refrain that “coding is mostly Googling.”\nLearning to analyze data with software requires a lot of practice and attention to detail. It also requires a lot of time searching the internet for help. Learning to identify the right words and phrases in a Google search is part of building your coding skills.\nTry to stay focused on being in the process, not the outcome.\n\n\nWhen you get stuck…\n…there are many options to get unstuck:\n\nReview the slides. Pay very close attention to small details.\nTry something else to see if you get a new error.\nUse Google to search for possible answers or new explanations.\nWatch a help video on YouTube on the topic.\nRe-start your web-browser or device.\nTry another web-browser or device.\nAsk a peer. Or an advanced student.\nStart or join a weekly study group.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\nEmail your TA\n\nWhen none of these strategies fix the issue, it is time to ask for help.\n\n\n\nHow to get help\nThe best quantitative researchers produce a trail for their code so that future researchers can replicate their analysis.\n\nHeads Up!\nReplication principles should be used when asking for help.\n\n\nGoal: Make someone else feel your pain!\n\nHow do you make someone else feel your pain?\n\n\nCreate a trail!\n\n\n\n\nCreate a reproducible example\n\nAssume others know nothing about your issue.\nDescribe your steps to create the problem so that someone else can replicate it.\nThis means clearly describing the issue and the steps you’ve already taken to solve it.\n\n\n\n\nGood etiquette\nSearch for answers before posting your question.\nLet me google that for you. 🙄 \nDescribe the problem.\n“It doesn’t work” isn’t descriptive enough. \nDescribe your environment.\nWhat operating system are you using? Which R version? What packages? Dataset?\n\nDescribe the solution.\nConfirm if a solution offered works. Or, if you solve it on your own, post how you solved it.\n\n\n\nHelp in this class\nIn this class, the fastest way to get help on milestones or your research brief is during the lab. The second fastest way is to post your reproducible example on the Quercus discussion board.\nIf none of these solve your problem, draft an email to your TA, with detailed notes about the problem and the troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken. You might be surprised how often even writing the problem out in detail helps you find the answer on your own. Send your email if you still need assistance.\nBefore requesting an individual meeting with a TA:\n\nSpend a sufficient amount of time working on it on your own.\nAsk two of your peers.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\n\nWhen emailing:\n\nExplain what troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken.\nReport who you’ve already asked for help."

There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "text": "Author Naomi Wolf wrote a book about the treatment of homosexuality in 19th century England. She reported that it was punishable by death since “sodomy” charges were followed by “death recorded” in the judicial logs. However, “sodomy” referred to a host of other sexual offenses, and “death recorded” specifically means they weren’t killed because their death was recorded but not carried out.\nPaul Dolan wrote a book about how marriage makes you miserable. A key part of his evidence was that in the American Time Use Survey, married people surveyed about their happiness when the spouse was present reported being happy, but when the spouse was absent they reported being unhappy. Covering up unhappiness in front of their spouse, truly miserable! But while Dolan read spouse present/absent as “spouse is in the room during questioning”, it actually meant “spouse together/separated.” He was comparing couples that were together vs. couples that were separating!"

    "text": "R environment\nNormally, tutorials are self-contained in your web-browser – everything you need to do will take place within the tutorial.\nHowever, we need to set up your computing environment before the first interactive-lecture. So, we’re going to make an exception this one time.\nLearning to write a computer program to print Hello, World! to your screen is often the first thing you learn in programming.\nTo make sure you are ready use a computer program (R) to work with data, let’s set up your device to use R to print this sentence to your screen.\n\n\nComputational toolkit:\n\nR: The programming language you’ll learn in this course.\nRStudio: The software you’ll use to write R code in.\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and Install R\nR is available through the web page of The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\nThe top of the web page provides three links for downloading R. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux. Complete instructions area available from rstudio-education, with key steps listed below.\n\nR: Windows\nTo install R on Windows, click the “Download R for Windows” link.\nThen click the “base” link.\nNext, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link should say something like “Download R 4.5.1 for Windows.” (Note: 4.5.1 will be replaced by the most current version of R.)\nThe link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows.\nRun this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. You’ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n\n\nWindows Help Video\nIf you prefer to watch a video or would like more details, I recommend Windows users watch this video. Or, you can search out a video yourself if you prefer.\n\n\n\nR: Mac\nTo install R on a Mac, click the “Download R for Mac” link. Next, click on the R-4.5.1 package link (or the package link for the most current release of R). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users. If your computer requires a password before installing new progams, you’ll need it here.\n\n\n\nMAC Help Video\nIf you prefer to watch a video or would like more details, I recommend Mac users watch this video. Or, you can search out a video yourself if you prefer.\n\n\n\nDownload & Install R-studio\nAfter you have installed R, you are ready to begin this section! In your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Edge), go to: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nSince you’ve already installed R, you’re reading for step 2.\nClick on the \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS/MAC0S\" button.\nThis is a big file, so it may take a few minutes to download. Once it’s downloaded, click on the file to install it.\n\n\nOpen RStudio\nOnce you’ve installed R and RStudio, locate RStudio and open it.\nWindows Users: you’ll find RStudio by either using the Windows search bar or clicking on the Windows start button and then typing “RStudio.”\nMac Users: RStudio will can be found in your launchpad, or you can drag and drop it to your applications folder. Click “Open” when asked if you want to open the program that has been downloaded from the internet. If a pop-up asks if you want to install “git” tools, you can click “Cancel” (not necessary for this class).\n\nprint()\nIn RStudio (not in this tutorial), put your cursor next to the &gt; and type: print(\"Hello, World!)\nThen press enter. You should see your sentence appear below it.\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nprint is case-sensitive (e.g., don’t capitalize “p”). Include the parentheses and quotes. Move your cursor to after the last “)” before hitting “Enter”.\n\n\nCongrats! You’re ready to begin analyzing data!"

    "text": "Statistics Vocabulary\nI’m interested in sociology. Why do I have to learn about statistics?\nStudents often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. Watch this video for a summary of how sociologists do sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].\n\n\nBefore we can analyze data, we need to identify the unit of analysis: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.\nRarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.\n\nPOPULATION\nAll units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.\n\n\n\nSAMPLE\nA subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.\n\n\n\nA note on notation:\nN refers to population size\nn refers to sample size\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.\n\nCapital letters are typically used when describing a population. Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\nIn this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "section": "Frequency Distributions",
    "text": "Frequency Distributions\nOnce we’ve collected the data from a sample, we evaluate the responses. Are all the responses alike? Did people pick one answer category more than others? Are lots of people middle class or are some people very poor and some people really rich?\nTo answer these questions, researchers analyze the distribution of the data.\n\nDISTRIBUTION:\nShows all the possible values (or intervals) of the data and how often they occur.\n\n\n\nFREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION\nA table reporting the number of observations falling into each category of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Tables\nA common first step in data analysis is to create a table showing the number of observations for each value of a variable. This is called a frequency table. It consists of two columns.\nThe first column includes the variable and the response categories.\nThe second column reports the number of cases in each category, as well as the total number of cases (i.e., sum of all frequencies).\n\nTable 01. Attitudes about sex before marriage\n\nSurvey question: There’s been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is ____________.\n\nFrequency tables are important for understanding data, but sometimes they can be misleading if the frequencies aren’t considered in context.\nLet’s look at an example.\n\n\nThink Like a Statistician:\nAre women more likely than men to say premarital sex is “not wrong at all”?\n\n\nWe start by looking at the frequency table that shows men and women’s number of responses for each category.\nTable 02. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender\n\n\npremarsxmalefemalealways wrong4,1597,116almost always wrong1,4992,388wrong only sometimes3,9044,792not wrong at all10,67211,086Total20,23425,382\n\n\nSource: U.S. General Social Survey, 1972-2024\n\nThe table shows that 10,672 men and 11,086 women in the survey stated sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nIf 414 more women than men thought premarital sex was “not wrong at all”, why can’t we conclude that women are more likely than men to think sex before marriage is ‘not wrong at all?’\n\n\n\n\nRelative Frequency Distributions\nExamine the table again to see the total number of men and women in the sample. More women than men answered the survey, which we didn’t consider when comparing the frequencies alone.\n\nRELATIVE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION\nA table showing the proportion or percentage for each value of a variable.\n\nTo account for the greater number of women than men in our sample, we use a ‘relative frequency distribution,’ showing either proportions or percentages to make our comparison.\nProportions are between 0 and 1.0.\n\\(Proportion = \\frac{f}{n}\\)\nPercentages are between 0 and 100.\n\\(Percentage = proportion × 100.\\)\nIn our table, we need two numbers to make the calculations.\n\nThe count of men who said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all’ (f = 10,672)\n\nThe total number of men who answered the survey question (n = 20,234)\n\n\\(\\frac{10,672}{20,234} = .53\\)\nThis is the proportion of men who said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nIt’s often easier to talk about these numbers in percentages. So, we just multiply the proportion (.53) by 100.\n53% of men said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nLet’s use R as a calculator to do the same thing for women.\nClick the Run Code button below.\n\n\n(11086/25382)*100\n\n\n\n\n\n(11086/25382)*100\n\n\n\nHINT: Just push the Run Code button to see the output.\n\n\nIn other words, 44% of women said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\n\nWhen do the same calculation for each category for both men and women, we can display these numbers in a frequency table.\nTable 03. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender\n\n\nMenWomenpremarsxn%n%always wrong4,159217,11628almost always wrong1,49972,3889wrong only sometimes3,904194,79219not wrong at all10,6725311,08644Total20,23410025,382100\n\n\nSource: U.S. General Social Survey, 1972-2024\n\nHeads Up!\nPercentage columns ALWAYS sum to 100%.\n\\({21 + 7 + 19 + 53 = 100\\%}\\)\n\n\nLet’s review our findings: 53% of men but only 44% of women reported sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\n\nYour Data Take!\nA greater proportion of men (53%) than women (44%) say premarital sex is “not wrong at all.”\n\nTo summarize, in order to compare meaningfully across groups, a frequency should be converted into a proportion or a percentage.\n\n PRACTICE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Backwards\nYou can also work backwards to calculate a frequency for a particular category if all you know is the percentage for the category and the total frequency.\nFor example, if you know that 9% of women from a sample of 25,382 believe sex before marriage is ‘almost always wrong,’ you can calculate the number of women in this category.\n\\(proportion * total freq = freq\\)\nLet’s use R as a calculator to prove it to ourselves:\nReplace the blank line with x to calculate the frequency from the proportion. Then, click the Run Code button below to confirm your results.\n\n\n# Get the %\nx &lt;- 2388/25382\n\nx # show x\n\n# Get the freq\n__ * 25382\n\n\n\n\n\n# Get the %\nx &lt;- 2388/25382\n\nx # show x\n\n# Get the freq\nx * 25382\n\n\n\nHINT: Did you replace __ with the letter ‘x’ (no quotes)?\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Distributions\nThere’s one more distribution to know about.\n\nCumulative Distribution\nA table showing the number or percentage of observations at or below a given category.\n\n\nSometimes researchers want to know the percentage of people in two or more categories. These descriptions are displayed as cumulative distributions.\nMaybe we wanted to know the percentage of people who think premarital sex is always OR almost always wrong. We need to sum the percentages from each of the categories to get our answer.\nIn 2024, 23% of people reported premarital sex is ‘always’ or ‘almost always’ wrong.\nTable 04. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender\n\n\npremarsxn%cumulative %always wrong3571717almost always wrong122623wrong only sometimes2581235not wrong at all1,37865100Total2,115100175\n\n\nSource: U.S. General Social Survey, 2024\n\\({\\color{mathGreen} 17} + {\\color{mathOrange} 6} = {\\color{mathRed} 23\\%}\\)\n\n\nRates\nSometimes it makes sense to report frequencies as rates, rather than as proportions or percentages. Common rates sociologists might be interested in include the marriage rate, birth rate, or crime rate.\n\nRATES\n\\(\\frac{Actual\\;occurrences}{possible\\;occurrences}\\)\n\n\nRates are often expressed per 1,000 or 100,000. (Calculate basic rate and multiply it by 1,000 or 100,000.)\nExamples:\n\nCanada’s divorce rate decreased from 12.7 per 1,000 in 1991 to 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020.\n\nThe 2021 suicide rate of 14.8 per 100,000 population for middle aged Canadians (30-59 years old) was the highest of any age group.\n\nCanada’s total fertility rate reached a new low in 2023 of 1.26 children per woman.\n\n\nRates can also be calculated for sub-groups.\n\nAs this chart shows, nearly 100 in 100,000 Black men and boys will be killed by U.S. police over the life course. Notice the different ways rates can be conveyed:\n\nLatino men and boys have an estimated risk of being killed by police of about 53 per 100,000.\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander men and boys face a lifetime risk of between 9 and 23 per 100,000.\n\nWhite men and boys face a lifetime risk of about 39 per 100,000.\n\n\n\nHeads up!\nThe denominator must include all possible occurrences.\n\n\nCan the divorce rate be calculated as follows?\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Number couples divorcing in 2024}}{\\text{Number couples marrying in 2024}}\\)\nNo! The denominator should consist of all couples who could divorce—including every couple that is married at any point in 2024, even if they got married before 2024.\n\n\nSummary:\nNominal variables:\ncan have frequency distributions, cannot have cumulative frequency distributions\nOrdinal:\ncan have frequency distributions and cumulative frequency distributions\nInterval-ratio:\ncan have frequency distributions, cumulative frequency distributions, and rates\n\n\n\nFigures\nSociologists want to understand data because it helps us understand the social world. Raw data, like the distributions we have reviewed, are often presented as statistical graphs. Graphing data helps people get the overall summary of a large amount of information quickly.\nTables are especially good at conveying the details about the relationship between variables. But, graphs help direct attention to the take-away of the relationship, helping people focus on the bigger picture rather than the details.\nLet’s consider some examples. Each of the graphs below could be presented as a table. But, the audience would have to work very hard to get the take-away point of the data from a table.\n\nA bar graph is used:\nfor nominal or ordinal variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\nusing separated rectangles, with height proportional\nto the frequency or percentage.\n\n\nA histogram is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\nusing separated rectangles, with height proportional\nto the frequency or percentage.\n\n\nA line graph is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\njoining by category the frequency or average with a line.\n\n\nA statistical map is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show geographical variations, often in ratios,\nusing variation in color or hue."
