Social Statistics Basics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**I'm interested in sociology. Why do I have to learn about statistics?**]{.shadows-text style="color: #F39C12; font-size: 150%;"}

Students often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. 
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhK-iEyXYA) 
for a summary of how sociologists *do* sociology and
how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].  
  
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhK-iEyXYA)  

<br>

Before we can analyze data, we need to identify the **unit of analysis**: who or what is being studied. 
The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.  

Rarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.

::: {.my-callout}
#### POPULATION
All units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.
:::
  
  
::: {.my-callout}
#### SAMPLE
A subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.
:::
  
<br>

#### A note on notation: 

[**N**]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to **population** size  
  
[***n***]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to **sample** size

<br>

::: {.my-tip}
#### Heads Up!
The capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.
:::

Capital letters are typically used when describing a population.
Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.

### Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics

In this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. 
There are two types of statistics:  


::: {.my-callout}
#### DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Procedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.
:::
  
  
::: {.my-callout}
#### INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
Making underlying predictions or inferences about a _population_ using observations and analyses from a _sample._ 
::: 
  
<br>  
  
Watch this short [video](https://youtu.be/87rxkjYNHUk)
for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].  
  
![](https://youtu.be/87rxkjYNHUk)
  
<br />  
  
We will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.

<br>  


`r fa("otter", fill = "#F39C12")`<practice> PRACTICE:</practice>

*Indicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics*

```{r P01, echo=FALSE}
  question("The number of Toronto residents who were homeless in 2024.",
         answer("Descriptive", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Inferential"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r P02, echo=FALSE}
  question("Determining studentsâ€™ opinion about the quality of dining options at UofT based on a sample of 100 students.",
         answer("Inferential", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Descriptive", message = "Hint: The phrase 'based on' in the statement means _inferences_ are being made."),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


### Tidy Data  
  
Quantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, 
where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (*think* spreadsheets).

[__Tidy data__](https://medium.com/@prabhakar_p/importance-of-tidy-data-and-its-impact-on-data-analysis-22e2e5acd90d) is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format 
(how the data is organized in rows and columns).

Tidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a "respondent"). 
**Each column generally represents a single variable.**  
  
![](images/variable.png "Cartoon graph with a thought bubble saying 'Wait. What's a variable?'"){ width=60% }
<br />


::: {.my-callout}
#### VARIABLES
Any factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types. 
::: 


Variables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. 
They can be thought of as characteristics that *vary*. 

Variables must be **mutually exclusive** (classify every observation) and **exhaustive** (one category for each observation).
  
  
There are three rules that make a dataset tidy:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

  
![](images/tidy-data.png "Three tables showing variables as columns, observations as rows, values in individual cells."){ width=75% }

<br />

To conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. 
There are different ways that variables can be measured.  
  
Consider how we might measure *happiness* in a survey.  
  
People could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. 
We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! 
Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).  
  
These options are all different _levels of measurement_.  
  
<br />  


### Measurement Levels  
  
  
__Watch this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZxnzfnt5v8){target="_blank"} explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].__

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZxnzfnt5v8)



#### **Terms**

[**DICHOTOMOUS** (aka binary)]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}
A variable with only two categories. 

[**NOMINAL**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}  
A variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.  

[**ORDINAL**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}
A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.  

[**INTERVAL-RATIO**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}
A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.

***

#### **Transforming Variables**  
One kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. 
Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.
  
  
<br />

[Example:]{style="color: #F39C12;"}  
Years of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into "high school graduate" vs. "not a graduate."
  
  
![](images/levels.png "Cartoon examples of Nominal, Ordinal, and Binary variable types."){ width=100% }

<br />
`r fa("otter", fill = "#DB9C1B")`<practice> PRACTICE:</practice>

  
*Identify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data.*

```{r P03, echo=FALSE}
  question("Satisfaction rating (extremely dislike, dislike, neutral, like, extremely like)",
           answer("nominal", message = "Try again. These responses have a ranked order."),
           answer("ordinal", correct = TRUE, message = "Amazing!"),
           answer("interval-ratio", message = "Try again. The differences between adjacent categories do not necessarily have the same meaning."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

```{r P04, echo=FALSE}
  question("Amount of money in savings accounts",
           answer("interval-ratio", correct = TRUE, message = "Splendid!"),
           answer("nominal", message = "Try again. This isn't a variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank."),
           answer("ordinal",  message = "Try again. The difference between two values is meaningful."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```
