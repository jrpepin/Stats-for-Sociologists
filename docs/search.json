Homework assignments will include a mixture of conceptual and applied (computational) questions; in the latter case, directions will specify whether calculations should be done by hand or using R. Each homework will be weighted equally.\nAssignments are due by the beginning of class on the specified date. They should be uploaded to the designated spot on Quercus (NOT emailed to your professor or TA). Show your work, round numbers appropriately (when doing calculations retain at least four decimal places; when presenting your final answer, round to two decimal places), and be neat and organized.\nYou may work together in small groups on homework assignments. Remember, however, that working through the homework is the best preparation for the exam and a measure of your understanding of course material. Even if you work with others, you must write up and turn in your own homework."

Are there any other possible interpretations? What limitations might there be in your data or analysis that affect how well we can answer the question?\n\nDetails on the research brief, including choice of datasets, will be given at a later date.\nNOTE: To keep you on track and to provide feedback along the way, you will submit Table 01 (including your research question and data section) earlier in the semester (5%).

However, a due date for a milestone assignment can be extended for a legitimate reason with proper documentation (e.g., illness, family emergency, religious observance, accessibility accommodation) according to UofT’s guidelines. Late Research Briefs will be penalized at a rate of 2% per day up to 10% (5 days) and will not be accepted thereafter, except where there are legitimate, documented reasons beyond a student’s control. Flash Presentations, given their in class participatory nature, cannot be extended.\nNote: Extensions beyond the term end date (not the last day of instruction but the actual end of term, e.g., the last day of a fall term class may be December 1st, but the term ends December 23rd) requires a discussion with the instructor and the graduate office, as well as completion of an SGS request for an extension of course work form. These forms will be considered by the graduate office and are not automatically approved."

    "text": "Plagiarism Detection\nTurnitin plagiarism detection software is integrated within Quercus. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site. I am not comfortable with the widespread use of this software, which effectively provides large quantities of student work to a for-profit company whose future business uses may include using it to train machine learning and AI tools. Consequently, none of the assignments for this course are set for automatic review by Turnitin. However, if I have reason to suspect plagiarism, I may use this tool to detect plagiarism.\nIf you object to your work being subject to review by Turnitin, add a comment when you submit your assignment. If I do find that we need to review your assignment for plagiarism and you have asked that I not use Turnitin, I will ask that you provide sufficient secondary material (e.g., reading notes, outlines of the paper, rough drafts of the final draft, etc.) to establish that the paper you submit is truly yours. If you cannot or decline to provide the requested documentation and do not consent to us using Turnitin for review, I will decline to mark the assignment.\nPlagiarism: Be careful to avoid plagiarism. It is a serious academic offense with serious penalties (see the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters). Do not present someone else’s ideas as your own. Give proper references to others’ ideas, and use quotation marks if you are quoting. When in doubt, err on the side of a reference. Turning in an old paper, or large parts thereof, for credit in a second (or third etc.) course, is considered an academic offense that results in students being referred off to the Office of Academic Integrity."

I encourage you to limit your use to technical coding support/reference, grammar/copy editing, and outlining. Be aware that AI tools are often wrong, overly generic, and lacking in critical nuance. My expectations for you are considerably higher than that. You will need to be more persuasive and creative at linking sociological research with empirical data, thinking critically, and making connections between data and theory than any of these tools. Over-reliance on AI will prevent you from learning the skills necessary to complete work at the level expected for this class. Students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit."

    "text": "Why am I making you learn something so frustrating?\n\nCalculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult.\n\nGood social science is built on replication.\n\nYou’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nIt is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data."

Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\n\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up."

    "text": "Author Naomi Wolf wrote a book about the treatment of homosexuality in 19th century England. She reported that it was punishable by death since “sodomy” charges were followed by “death recorded” in the judicial logs. However, “sodomy” referred to a host of other sexual offenses, and “death recorded” specifically means they weren’t killed because their death was recorded but not carried out.\nPaul Dolan wrote a book about how marriage makes you miserable. A key part of his evidence was that in the American Time Use Survey, married people surveyed about their happiness when the spouse was present reported being happy, but when the spouse was absent they reported being unhappy. Covering up unhappiness in front of their spouse, truly miserable! But while Dolan read spouse present/absent as “spouse is in the room during questioning”, it actually meant “spouse together/separated.” He was comparing couples that were together vs. couples that were separating!"

Commonly, in social sciences, rows are referred to as “observations” and columns as “variables.” In our case, there are 75,699 observations (e.g., respondents) and 6,867 variables.\nYou can also load the GSS data for a specific survey year.\n\n# Get the data only for the 2024 survey respondents\ngss24 &lt;- gss_get_yr(2024)\n\nFetching: https://gss.norc.org/documents/stata/2024_stata.zip\n\n# look at the first 6 rows of the dataframe\nhead(gss24)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 639\n  year        id wrkstat hrs1        hrs2        evwork      marital martype    \n  &lt;dbl+lb&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+l&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;   &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;   &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;   &lt;dbl+l&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;  \n1 2024         1 1 [wor…    43       NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap] 5 [nev… NA(i) [iap]\n2 2024         2 5 [ret… NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap]     1 [yes] 5 [nev… NA(i) [iap]\n3 2024         3 5 [ret… NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap]     1 [yes] 1 [mar…     1 [mar…\n4 2024         4 2 [wor…    20       NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap] 5 [nev… NA(i) [iap]\n5 2024         5 5 [ret… NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap]     1 [yes] 3 [div… NA(i) [iap]\n6 2024         6 4 [une… NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap] NA(i) [iap] 1 [mar…     1 [mar…\n# ℹ 631 more variables: divorce &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, widowed &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   spwrksta &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, sphrs1 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, sphrs2 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, spevwork &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   cowrksta &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, coevwork &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, cohrs1 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, cohrs2 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   sibs &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, childs &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, age &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, educ &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   speduc &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, coeduc &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, codeg &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, degree &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   padeg &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, madeg &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, spdeg &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, sex &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   race &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, res16 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, reg16 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, mobile16 &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;, …\n\n\nWith your mouse, go to the environment panel (upper-right) and click on the “gss24” object. It pops up and you can browse through it.\nThis is often a good idea to get a first feel for the data, but only if your dataset is relatively small.\nThe GSS documentation is available online in .pdf form.\nThe .pdfs will be useful for general overviews.\nFor specific variable information, it will be helpful to use the documentation you’ll load into RStudio.\n\n# Load the codebook\ndata(gss_dict)\n\nTo see the variables available in the dataset, use the names() command. This command is best to use with smaller datasets.\n\nnames(gss_all)\n\n   [1] \"year\"            \"id\"              \"wrkstat\"         \"hrs1\"           \n   [5] \"hrs2\"            \"evwork\"

    "text": "Social Statistics Basics\nI’m interested in sociology. Why do I have to learn about statistics?\nStudents often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. Watch this video for a summary of how sociologists do sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].\n\n\nBefore we can analyze data, we need to identify the unit of analysis: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.\nRarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.\n\nPOPULATION\nAll units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.\n\n\nSAMPLE\nA subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.\n\n\n\nA note on notation:\nN refers to population size\nn refers to sample size\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.\n\nCapital letters are typically used when describing a population. Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\nIn this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "text": "Learning to Code\n\nTechnology is fun!\nYou’re not just learning the statistical concepts in this course, but how to produce the statistics. Analyzing data requires learning to use new technology.\nLearning statistical software to analyze data can be really fun. You get to learn about real world social problems!\n\n\nTechnology is challenging!\nBut, it can also be frustrating. There’s even a bingo card of common errors (i.e. bugs) that new statistical programmers will expect to experience.\n\n\nWhy are you making me learn something so frustrating?\nOne reason is that calculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult. You’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nThe second reason to learn statistical software is because good social science is built on replication. It is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data.\nBut technology presents its own challenges. Replication using technology requires researchers to use sometimes unfamiliar software, working on devices with unique environments and settings.\nWhen it feels like the technology is preventing you from getting to the course content, take a deep breath, and remember that building your technology skills is part of this course.\n\n\nFailure\nA common misconception is that some people are just not math (or tech) people. This is a myth.\n\n“People’s belief that ‘math ability’ can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”\n\nConfidence and persistence likely have a larger role in math ability than genetics.\n\nIt is important to remain process oriented rather than product oriented. Instead of focusing on outcomes, such as external rewards (grades), focus on your learning process. How do you do that? One approach is to change your mindset.\nAdopting a “growth mindset” will help you get the most out of this course. A growth mindset is the belief that your skills and abilities can develop (through work and practice).\nAnother key to increasing your confidence is to expect failure. Failure is part of learning. When students are afraid of failing, it is harder for them to learn. But, research shows that students must occasionally fail, and even be frustrated at times, to really learn.\nGet comfortable with making mistakes right now. Failure is part of the learning process. Your job is to persist.\nYour code is not expected to be perfect the first time. Identifying and fixing errors in your own code is such an inherent part of the process, there’s even a name for it: debugging\n\n\n\n\nGrappling\nLearning to use statistical software necessitates grappling.\n\nGrappling implies trying even before you fail the first time.\nIt’s thinking, “First, I’ll work with it independently. Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up.\nIf you learn one thing in this course, I want you to walk away having better problem solving skills. This is because most statistical analyses happen not because the person is a math genius, but because they persisted through the minefield of technical issues by being excellent problem-solvers.\nCoding is mostly Googling\nIt is a misperception that the best statistical analysts sit down at their computers and type code from memory. In fact, much of process of coding is copying code from somewhere else and modifying it to fit your particular situation. There’s even a common refrain that “coding is mostly Googling.”\nLearning to analyze data with software requires a lot of practice and attention to detail. It also requires a lot of time searching the internet for help. Learning to identify the right words and phrases in a Google search is part of building your coding skills.\nTry to stay focused on being in the process, not the outcome.\n\n\nWhen you get stuck…\n…there are many options to get unstuck:\n\nReview the slides. Pay very close attention to small details.\nTry something else to see if you get a new error.\nUse Google to search for possible answers or new explanations.\nWatch a help video on YouTube on the topic.\nRe-start your web-browser or device.\nTry another web-browser or device.\nAsk a peer. Or an advanced student.\nStart or join a weekly study group.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\nEmail your TA\n\nWhen none of these strategies fix the issue, it is time to ask for help.\n\n\n\nHow to get help\nThe best quantitative researchers produce a trail for their code so that future researchers can replicate their analysis.\n\nHeads Up!\nReplication principles should be used when asking for help.\n\nWhen asking for help, do what you can to create a reproducible example. The goal is for someone else to feel your pain. How do you make someone else feel your pain?\n\n\nCreate a trail!\n\n\n\n\nCreate a reproducible example\n\nGoal: Make someone else feel your pain!\n\n\nAssume others know nothing about your issue.\nDescribe your steps to create the problem so that someone else can replicate it.\nThis means clearly describing the issue and the steps you’ve already taken to solve it.\n\n\n\n\nGood etiquette\nSearch for answers before posting your question.\nLet me google that for you. 🙄 \nDescribe the problem.\n“It doesn’t work” isn’t descriptive enough. \nDescribe your environment.\nWhat operating system are you using? Which R version? What packages? Dataset?\n\nDescribe the solution.\nConfirm if a solution offered works. Or, if you solve it on your own, post how you solved it.\n\n\n\nHelp in this class\nIn this class, the fastest way to get help on milestones or your research brief is during the lab. The second fastest way is to post your reproducible example on the Quercus discussion board.\nIf none of these solve your problem, draft an email to your TA, with detailed notes about the problem and the troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken. You might be surprised how often even writing the problem out in detail helps you find the answer on your own. Send your email if you still need assistance.\nBefore requesting an individual meeting with a TA:\n\nSpend a sufficient amount of time working on it on your own.\nAsk two of your peers.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\n\nWhen emailing:\n\nExplain what troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken.\nReport who you’ve already asked for help."
