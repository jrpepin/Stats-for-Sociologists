Homework assignments will include a mixture of conceptual and applied (computational) questions; in the latter case, directions will specify whether calculations should be done by hand or using R. Each homework will be weighted equally.\nAssignments are due by the beginning of class on the specified date. They should be uploaded to the designated spot on Quercus (NOT emailed to your professor or TA). Show your work, round numbers appropriately (when doing calculations retain at least four decimal places; when presenting your final answer, round to two decimal places), and be neat and organized.\nYou may work together in small groups on homework assignments. Remember, however, that working through the homework is the best preparation for the exam and a measure of your understanding of course material. Even if you work with others, you must write up and turn in your own homework."

    "text": "Plagiarism Detection\nTurnitin plagiarism detection software is integrated within Quercus. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site. I am not comfortable with the widespread use of this software, which effectively provides large quantities of student work to a for-profit company whose future business uses may include using it to train machine learning and AI tools. Consequently, none of the assignments for this course are set for automatic review by Turnitin. However, if I have reason to suspect plagiarism, I may use this tool to detect plagiarism.\nIf you object to your work being subject to review by Turnitin, add a comment when you submit your assignment. If I do find that we need to review your assignment for plagiarism and you have asked that I not use Turnitin, I will ask that you provide sufficient secondary material (e.g., reading notes, outlines of the paper, rough drafts of the final draft, etc.) to establish that the paper you submit is truly yours. If you cannot or decline to provide the requested documentation and do not consent to us using Turnitin for review, I will decline to mark the assignment.\nPlagiarism: Be careful to avoid plagiarism. It is a serious academic offense with serious penalties (see the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters). Do not present someone else’s ideas as your own. Give proper references to others’ ideas, and use quotation marks if you are quoting. When in doubt, err on the side of a reference. Turning in an old paper, or large parts thereof, for credit in a second (or third etc.) course, is considered an academic offense that results in students being referred off to the Office of Academic Integrity."

I encourage you to limit your use to technical coding support/reference, grammar/copy editing, and outlining. Be aware that AI tools are often wrong, overly generic, and lacking in critical nuance. My expectations for you are considerably higher than that. You will need to be more persuasive and creative at linking sociological research with empirical data, thinking critically, and making connections between data and theory than any of these tools. Over-reliance on AI will prevent you from learning the skills necessary to complete work at the level expected for this class. Students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit."

    "text": "Why am I making you learn something so frustrating?\n\nCalculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult.\n\nGood social science is built on replication.\n\nYou’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nIt is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data."

Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\n\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up."

    "text": "Author Naomi Wolf wrote a book about the treatment of homosexuality in 19th century England. She reported that it was punishable by death since “sodomy” charges were followed by “death recorded” in the judicial logs. However, “sodomy” referred to a host of other sexual offenses, and “death recorded” specifically means they weren’t killed because their death was recorded but not carried out.\nPaul Dolan wrote a book about how marriage makes you miserable. A key part of his evidence was that in the American Time Use Survey, married people surveyed about their happiness when the spouse was present reported being happy, but when the spouse was absent they reported being unhappy. Covering up unhappiness in front of their spouse, truly miserable! But while Dolan read spouse present/absent as “spouse is in the room during questioning”, it actually meant “spouse together/separated.” He was comparing couples that were together vs. couples that were separating!"

It is strongly recommended that you re-try these practice questions until you have mastered the concepts.\nThe otter icon symbolizes playfulness, curiosity, and emotional intelligence. It’s a reminder to take a lighthearted approach to learning statistics.\nLet’s try it out.\n\n PRACTICE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt times, you may also be asked to practice interpretation of R output within the tutorials. The code will be pre-written for you and all you will have to do is click the ‘Run’ button to see the results.\nOther times, you will practice coding by revising existing code or manually typing in your own code to run. You can’t break the tutorial code. If you get an error message, press the ‘Start Over’ button and the code will automatically reset to the default.

Why do I have to learn about statistics?\nStudents often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. Watch this video for a summary of how sociologists do sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].\n\n\nBefore we can analyze data, we need to identify the unit of analysis: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.\nRarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.\n\nPOPULATION\nAll units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.\n\n\nSAMPLE\nA subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.\n\n\n\nA note on notation:\nN refers to population size\nn refers to sample size\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.\n\nCapital letters are typically used when describing a population. Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\nIn this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "text": "Learning to Code\n\nTechnology is fun!\nYou’re not just learning the statistical concepts in this course, but how to produce the statistics. Analyzing data requires learning to use new technology.\nLearning statistical software to analyze data can be really fun. You get to learn about real world social problems!\n\n\nTechnology is challenging!\nBut, it can also be frustrating. There’s even a bingo card of common errors (i.e. bugs) that new statistical programmers will expect to experience.\n\n\nWhy are you making me learn something so frustrating?\nOne reason is that calculating the statistics by hand quickly gets cumbersome, time consuming, and difficult. You’ll learn the statistical techniques using small sample sizes, but to really understand the social world, datasets typically have 100s, 1,000s, even 100,000s of values.\nThe second reason to learn statistical software is because good social science is built on replication. It is impractical, and more prone to errors, for scientists to replicate research by hand. Replication of statistical procedures helps catch minor coding errors, highlights unusual decisions made by researchers, inappropriate statistical techniques, and corrupted data.\nBut technology presents its own challenges. Replication using technology requires researchers to use sometimes unfamiliar software, working on devices with unique environments and settings.\nWhen it feels like the technology is preventing you from getting to the course content, take a deep breath, and remember that building your technology skills is part of this course.\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure\nA common misconception is that some people are just not math (or tech) people. This is a myth.\n\n“People’s belief that ‘math ability’ can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”\n\nConfidence and persistence likely have a larger role in math ability than genetics.\n\nIt is important to remain process oriented rather than product oriented. Instead of focusing on outcomes, such as external rewards (grades), focus on your learning process. How do you do that? One approach is to change your mindset.\nAdopting a “growth mindset” will help you get the most out of this course. A growth mindset is the belief that your skills and abilities can develop (through work and practice).\nAnother key to increasing your confidence is to expect failure. Failure is part of learning. When students are afraid of failing, it is harder for them to learn. But, research shows that students must occasionally fail, and even be frustrated at times, to really learn.\nGet comfortable with making mistakes right now. Failure is part of the learning process. Your job is to persist.\nYour code is not expected to be perfect the first time. Identifying and fixing errors in your own code is such an inherent part of the process, there’s even a name for it: debugging\n\n\n\n\nGrappling\nLearning to use statistical software necessitates grappling.\n\nGrappling implies trying even before you fail the first time.\nIt’s thinking, “First, I’ll work with it independently. Okay, I’m really not understanding it. Let me go back to my notes. Okay, I have solved for the first part of it. Now I have the second part of it. Okay, I got the question wrong; let me try again. Maybe I can ask my peer now.”\nGrappling is working hard to make sure you understand the problem fully, and then using every resource at your fingertips to solve it.”\n\nIn this course, this means you’ll put your active learning skills to use. You, not your professor or TA, will work through encountered problems. You, of course, will be supported and coached through the entire process. Working with statistical software will become easier as you build your skills in problem-solving errors. Unfortunately, it gets increasingly difficult if you rely on others to solve the issue, as the errors stack-up.\nIf you learn one thing in this course, I want you to walk away having better problem solving skills. This is because most statistical analyses happen not because the person is a math genius, but because they persisted through the minefield of technical issues by being excellent problem-solvers.\nCoding is mostly Googling\nIt is a misperception that the best statistical analysts sit down at their computers and type code from memory. In fact, much of process of coding is copying code from somewhere else and modifying it to fit your particular situation. There’s even a common refrain that “coding is mostly Googling.”\nLearning to analyze data with software requires a lot of practice and attention to detail. It also requires a lot of time searching the internet for help. Learning to identify the right words and phrases in a Google search is part of building your coding skills.\nTry to stay focused on being in the process, not the outcome.\n\n\nWhen you get stuck…\n…there are many options to get unstuck:\n\nReview the slides. Pay very close attention to small details.\nTry something else to see if you get a new error.\nUse Google to search for possible answers or new explanations.\nWatch a help video on YouTube on the topic.\nRe-start your web-browser or device.\nTry another web-browser or device.\nAsk a peer. Or an advanced student.\nStart or join a weekly study group.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\nEmail your TA\n\nWhen none of these strategies fix the issue, it is time to ask for help.\n\n\n\nHow to get help\nThe best quantitative researchers produce a trail for their code so that future researchers can replicate their analysis.\n\nHeads Up!\nReplication principles should be used when asking for help.\n\n\nGoal: Make someone else feel your pain!\n\nHow do you make someone else feel your pain?\n\n\nCreate a trail!\n\n\n\n\nCreate a reproducible example\n\nAssume others know nothing about your issue.\nDescribe your steps to create the problem so that someone else can replicate it.\nThis means clearly describing the issue and the steps you’ve already taken to solve it.\n\n\n\n\nGood etiquette\nSearch for answers before posting your question.\nLet me google that for you. 🙄 \nDescribe the problem.\n“It doesn’t work” isn’t descriptive enough. \nDescribe your environment.\nWhat operating system are you using? Which R version? What packages? Dataset?\n\nDescribe the solution.\nConfirm if a solution offered works. Or, if you solve it on your own, post how you solved it.\n\n\n\nHelp in this class\nIn this class, the fastest way to get help on milestones or your research brief is during the lab. The second fastest way is to post your reproducible example on the Quercus discussion board.\nIf none of these solve your problem, draft an email to your TA, with detailed notes about the problem and the troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken. You might be surprised how often even writing the problem out in detail helps you find the answer on your own. Send your email if you still need assistance.\nBefore requesting an individual meeting with a TA:\n\nSpend a sufficient amount of time working on it on your own.\nAsk two of your peers.\nPost the question on the class discussion board.\n\nWhen emailing:\n\nExplain what troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken.\nReport who you’ve already asked for help."

There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "text": "Author Naomi Wolf wrote a book about the treatment of homosexuality in 19th century England. She reported that it was punishable by death since “sodomy” charges were followed by “death recorded” in the judicial logs. However, “sodomy” referred to a host of other sexual offenses, and “death recorded” specifically means they weren’t killed because their death was recorded but not carried out.\nPaul Dolan wrote a book about how marriage makes you miserable. A key part of his evidence was that in the American Time Use Survey, married people surveyed about their happiness when the spouse was present reported being happy, but when the spouse was absent they reported being unhappy. Covering up unhappiness in front of their spouse, truly miserable! But while Dolan read spouse present/absent as “spouse is in the room during questioning”, it actually meant “spouse together/separated.” He was comparing couples that were together vs. couples that were separating!"

So, we’re going to make an exception this one time.\nLearning to write a computer program to print Hello, World! to your screen is often the first thing you learn in programming.\nTo make sure you are ready use a computer program (R) to work with data, let’s set up your device to use R to print this sentence to your screen.\n\n\nComputational toolkit:\n\nR: The programming language you’ll learn in this course.\nRStudio: The software you’ll use to write R code in.\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and Install R\nR is available through the web page of The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\nThe top of the web page provides three links for downloading R. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux. Complete instructions area available from rstudio-education, with key steps listed below.\n\nR: Windows\nTo install R on Windows, click the “Download R for Windows” link.\nThen click the “base” link.\nNext, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link should say something like “Download R 4.5.1 for Windows.” (Note: 4.5.1 will be replaced by the most current version of R.)\nThe link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows.\nRun this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. You’ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n\n\nWindows Help Video\nIf you prefer to watch a video or would like more details, I recommend Windows users watch this video. Or, you can search out a video yourself if you prefer.\n\n\n\nR: Mac\nTo install R on a Mac, click the “Download R for Mac” link. Next, click on the R-4.5.1 package link (or the package link for the most current release of R). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users. If your computer requires a password before installing new progams, you’ll need it here.\n\n\n\nMAC Help Video\nIf you prefer to watch a video or would like more details, I recommend Mac users watch this video. Or, you can search out a video yourself if you prefer.\n\n\n\nDownload & Install R-studio\nAfter you have installed R, you are ready to begin this section! In your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Edge), go to: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nSince you’ve already installed R, you’re reading for step 2.\nClick on the \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS/MAC0S\" button.\nThis is a big file, so it may take a few minutes to download. Once it’s downloaded, click on the file to install it.\n\n\nOpen RStudio\nOnce you’ve installed R and RStudio, locate RStudio and open it.\nWindows Users: you’ll find RStudio by either using the Windows search bar or clicking on the Windows start button and then typing “RStudio.”\nMac Users: RStudio will can be found in your launchpad, or you can drag and drop it to your applications folder. Click “Open” when asked if you want to open the program that has been downloaded from the internet. If a pop-up asks if you want to install “git” tools, you can click “Cancel” (not necessary for this class).\n\nprint()\nIn RStudio (not in this tutorial), put your cursor next to the &gt; and type: print(\"Hello, World!)\nThen press enter. You should see your sentence appear below it.\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nprint is case-sensitive (e.g., don’t capitalize “p”). Include the parentheses and quotes. Move your cursor to after the last “)” before hitting “Enter”.\n\n\nCongrats! You’re ready to begin analyzing data!"

    "text": "Statistics Vocabulary\nI’m interested in sociology. Why do I have to learn about statistics?\nStudents often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are required to take this class. Watch this video for a summary of how sociologists do sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger picture [~10 minutes].\n\n\nBefore we can analyze data, we need to identify the unit of analysis: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.\nRarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of interest, so we usually take a sample.\n\nPOPULATION\nAll units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the researcher is interested.\n\n\n\nSAMPLE\nA subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a population.\n\n\n\nA note on notation:\nN refers to population size\nn refers to sample size\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are meaningful.\n\nCapital letters are typically used when describing a population. Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\nIn this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential statistics. There are two types of statistics:\n\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nProcedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a sample or population.\n\n\n\nINFERENTIAL STATISTICS\nMaking underlying predictions or inferences about a population using observations and analyses from a sample.\n\n\nWatch this short video for a more detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].\n\n\nWe will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the course, before moving on to inferential statistics.\n\n PRACTICE:\nIndicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data\nQuantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (think spreadsheets).\nTidy data is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the data is organized in rows and columns).\nTidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record or person (also called a “respondent”). Each column generally represents a single variable.\n \n\nVARIABLES\nAny factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or types.\n\nVariables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that vary.\nVariables must be mutually exclusive (classify every observation) and exhaustive (one category for each observation).\nThere are three rules that make a dataset tidy:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nTo conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can be measured.\nConsider how we might measure happiness in a survey.\nPeople could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and 10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful, anxious, and so on).\nThese options are all different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\nMeasurement Levels\nWatch this short video explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [~6 minutes].\n\n\nTerms\nDICHOTOMOUS (aka binary) A variable with only two categories.\nNOMINAL\nA variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank.\nORDINAL A variable made up of ranked categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference between the categories.\nINTERVAL-RATIO A variable with categories that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming Variables\nOne kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable. Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.\n\nExample:\nYears of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into “high school graduate” vs. “not a graduate.”\n  PRACTICE:\nIdentify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or interval-ratio level data."

    "section": "Frequency Distributions",
    "text": "Frequency Distributions\nOnce we’ve collected the data from a sample, we evaluate the responses. Are all the responses alike? Did people pick one answer category more than others? Are lots of people middle class or are some people very poor and some people really rich?\nTo answer these questions, researchers analyze the distribution of the data.\n\nDISTRIBUTION:\nShows all the possible values (or intervals) of the data and how often they occur.\n\n\n\nFREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION\nA table reporting the number of observations falling into each category of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Tables\nA common first step in data analysis is to create a table showing the number of observations for each value of a variable. This is called a frequency table. It consists of two columns.\nThe first column includes the variable and the response categories.\nThe second column reports the number of cases in each category, as well as the total number of cases (i.e., sum of all frequencies).\n\nTable 01. Attitudes about sex before marriage\n\nSurvey question: There’s been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is ____________.\n\nFrequency tables are important for understanding data, but sometimes they can be misleading if the frequencies aren’t considered in context.\nLet’s look at an example.\n\n\nThink Like a Statistician:\nAre women more likely than men to say premarital sex is “not wrong at all”?\n\n\nWe start by looking at the frequency table that shows men and women’s number of responses for each category.\nTable 02. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender\n\n\npremarsxmalefemalealways wrong4,1597,116almost always wrong1,4992,388wrong only sometimes3,9044,792not wrong at all10,67211,086Total20,23425,382\n\n\nSource: U.S. General Social Survey, 1972-2024\n\nThe table shows that 10,672 men and 11,086 women in the survey stated sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nIf 414 more women than men thought premarital sex was “not wrong at all”, why can’t we conclude that women are more likely than men to think sex before marriage is ‘not wrong at all?’\n\n\n\n\nRelative Frequency Distributions\nExamine the table again to see the total number of men and women in the sample. More women than men answered the survey, which we didn’t consider when comparing the frequencies alone.\n\nRELATIVE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION\nA table showing the proportion or percentage for each value of a variable.\n\nTo account for the greater number of women than men in our sample, we use a ‘relative frequency distribution,’ showing either proportions or percentages to make our comparison.\nProportions are between 0 and 1.0.\n\\(Proportion = \\frac{f}{n}\\)\nPercentages are between 0 and 100.\n\\(Percentage = proportion × 100.\\)\nIn our table, we need two numbers to make the calculations.\n\nThe count of men who said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all’ (f = 10,672)\n\nThe total number of men who answered the survey question (n = 20,234)\n\n\\(\\frac{10,672}{20,234} = .53\\)\nThis is the proportion of men who said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nIt’s often easier to talk about these numbers in percentages. So, we just multiply the proportion (.53) by 100.\n53% of men said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\nLet’s use R as a calculator to do the same thing for women.\nClick the Run Code button below.\n\n\n(11086/25382)*100\n\n\n\n\n\n(11086/25382)*100\n\n\n\nHINT: Just push the Run Code button to see the output.\n\n\nIn other words, 44% of women said sex before marriage was ‘not wrong at all.’\n\nWhen do the same calculation for each category for both men and women, we can display these numbers in a frequency table.\nTable 03.

Then, click the Run Code button below to confirm your results.\n\n\n# Get the %\nx &lt;- 2388/25382\n\nx # show x\n\n# Get the freq\n__ * 25382\n\n\n\n\n\n# Get the %\nx &lt;- 2388/25382\n\nx # show x\n\n# Get the freq\nx * 25382\n\n\n\nHINT: Did you replace __ with the letter ‘x’ (no quotes)?\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Distributions\nThere’s one more distribution to know about.\n\nCumulative Distribution\nA table showing the number or percentage of observations at or below a given category.\n\n\nSometimes researchers want to know the percentage of people in two or more categories. These descriptions are displayed as cumulative distributions.\nMaybe we wanted to know the percentage of people who think premarital sex is always OR almost always wrong. We need to sum the percentages from each of the categories to get our answer.\nIn 2024, 23% of people reported premarital sex is ‘always’ or ‘almost always’ wrong.\nTable 04. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender\n\n\npremarsxn%cumulative %always wrong3571717almost always wrong122623wrong only sometimes2581235not wrong at all1,37865100Total2,115100175\n\n\nSource: U.S. General Social Survey, 2024\n\\({\\color{mathGreen} 17} + {\\color{mathOrange} 6} = {\\color{mathRed} 23\\%}\\)\n\n\nRates\nSometimes it makes sense to report frequencies as rates, rather than as proportions or percentages. Common rates sociologists might be interested in include the marriage rate, birth rate, or crime rate.\n\nRATES\n\\(\\frac{Actual\\;occurrences}{possible\\;occurrences}\\)\n\n\nRates are often expressed per 1,000 or 100,000. (Calculate basic rate and multiply it by 1,000 or 100,000.)\nExamples:\n\nCanada’s divorce rate decreased from 12.7 per 1,000 in 1991 to 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020.\n\nThe 2021 suicide rate of 14.8 per 100,000 population for middle aged Canadians (30-59 years old) was the highest of any age group.\n\nCanada’s total fertility rate reached a new low in 2023 of 1.26 children per woman.\n\n\nRates can also be calculated for sub-groups.\n\nAs this chart shows, nearly 100 in 100,000 Black men and boys will be killed by U.S. police over the life course. Notice the different ways rates can be conveyed:\n\nLatino men and boys have an estimated risk of being killed by police of about 53 per 100,000.\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander men and boys face a lifetime risk of between 9 and 23 per 100,000.\n\nWhite men and boys face a lifetime risk of about 39 per 100,000.\n\n\n\nHeads up!\nThe denominator must include all possible occurrences.\n\n\nCan the divorce rate be calculated as follows?\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Number couples divorcing in 2024}}{\\text{Number couples marrying in 2024}}\\)\nNo! The denominator should consist of all couples who could divorce—including every couple that is married at any point in 2024, even if they got married before 2024.\n\n\nSummary:\nNominal variables:\ncan have frequency distributions, cannot have cumulative frequency distributions\nOrdinal:\ncan have frequency distributions and cumulative frequency distributions\nInterval-ratio:\ncan have frequency distributions, cumulative frequency distributions, and rates\n\n\n\nFigures\nSociologists want to understand data because it helps us understand the social world. Raw data, like the distributions we have reviewed, are often presented as statistical graphs. Graphing data helps people get the overall summary of a large amount of information quickly.\nTables are especially good at conveying the details about the relationship between variables. But, graphs help direct attention to the take-away of the relationship, helping people focus on the bigger picture rather than the details.\nLet’s consider some examples. Each of the graphs below could be presented as a table. But, the audience would have to work very hard to get the take-away point of the data from a table.\n\nA bar graph is used:\nfor nominal or ordinal variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\nusing separated rectangles, with height proportional\nto the frequency or percentage.\n\n\nA histogram is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\nusing separated rectangles, with height proportional\nto the frequency or percentage.\n\n\nA line graph is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show frequencies or percentages,\njoining by category the frequency or average with a line.\n\n\nA statistical map is used:\nfor interval-ratio variables,\nto show geographical variations, often in ratios,\nusing variation in color or hue."

Your Research Brief should include:\n\nQuestion: a clearly worded research question that can be answered with quantitative data.\nData: a description of the data you are using, including a description of all variables and how they are coded. A table of descriptive statistics of the total sample and key comparison groups and a narrative of the table.\nPlan of Analysis: a description of your analysis (i.e., how are you going to use the data to answer the research question?)\nResults: a presentation of the results, including a regression table and a figure.\nDiscussion: Provide an interpretation of the results – that is, given the results, what is the answer to the question? Are there any other possible interpretations? What limitations might there be in your data or analysis that affect how well we can answer the question?\n\nDetails on the research brief, including choice of datasets, will be given at a later date.\nNOTE: To keep you on track and to provide feedback along the way, you will submit Table 01 (including your research question and data section) earlier in the semester (5%). Your complete research brief submitted at the end of the semester will therefore be 20% of your final grade."

    "text": "Normal Distribution\nIn this course, we have been working with empirical distributions, distributions based on real data. In this tutorial, we’re going to focus on a theoretical distributions, which are based on probability theory.\nSpecifically, we will focus on normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of a normal distribution is that many empirical distributions that we study seem to take the shape of a normal distribution.\nThe normal distribution is unimodal (meaning there is only one mode), symmetrical, and bell shaped. The mean, median, and mode are all at the same central peak.\nWe can often learn a lot about the characteristics of these empirical distributions based on our knowledge of the normal distribution.\n\nNormal Distribution and Standard Deviations\nThe normal distribution is one of the most important concepts in statistics. So far, you’ve been calculating the standard deviations to understand the spread of a distribution.\nIt has probably seemed fairly abstract. But, standard deviations have a very important relationship to normal distributions.\nCheck out this video to learn why [5 minutes].\n\n\n\n68-95-99.7 Rule\nThe entire area under a normal curve is equal to 1.00 or 100% (1.00 × 100) of the observations. The mean of a normal distribution divides the observations exactly in half. Because the normal curve is perfectly symmetrical, exactly 0.50 (proportion) or 50% (percentage) of the observations lie above or to the right of the mean, and 50% lie below or to the left of the mean.\nThe standard deviations also have some magical properties. 34.13% of the observations lie between the mean and 1 standard deviation to the right of the mean. The same percentage lies between the mean and 1 standard deviation to the left of the mean.\nPositive standard deviations are located to the right of the mean, and negative standard deviations denote the area to the left of the mean.\nThus, 68.26% (34.13 + 34.13) of all the observations in the distribution occur between the mean and \\(±1\\) standard deviation.\nAnd, we can carry this out further. 95.46% of all observations in the distribution occur between the mean and ±2 standard deviations. 99.72% of the observations occur between the mean and ±3 standard deviations.\n\n\nWatch this video for a more detailed explanation of this concept [9 minutes].\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThere’s some math in this video……and you’ll be asked to make these calculations.\n\n\n\nReview\nRecall that the entire area under a normal curve is equal to 1.00 or 100% (1.00 × 100) of the observations. And, the standard deviation has some magical properties: 68-95-99.7 rule.\n\nRoughly 68% of all the observations in the distribution occur between the mean and \\(±1\\) standard deviation.\nRoughly 95% of all observations in the distribution occur between the mean and \\(±2\\) standard deviations.\nRoughly 99.72% of all observations occur between the mean and \\(±3\\) standard deviations.\n\n\nLet’s review with an example.\n\nThink Like a Statistician:\nWhat proportion of women think the ideal age of marriage is 28 or younger?\n\nPretend that, on average, women’s ideal age to marry is 26.19. And, the standard deviation is 2.07.\n\nThe value of interest, (\\(28\\)), is almost exactly 1 standard deviation away from the mean.\nHow do I know? Add one standard deviation (\\(2.07\\)) to our mean (\\(26.19\\)):\n\\(26.19 + 2.07 = 28.26\\)\nThat’s pretty close to 28.\nUsing this information, we can determine the\n\narea to the left of the mean is \\(.5\\).\n\narea between the mean and 1 standard deviation is half of \\(.68\\), or \\(.34\\).\n\nAdd these together:\n\\(.5 + .34 = .84\\)\n\nYour Data Take!\nAbout .84, or over 84%, of women think the ideal age of marriage is 28 or younger.\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to know the proportion of women who think the ideal age of marriage is 29 or younger?\nThis raw score (29) doesn’t exactly match one of the standard deviation values.\nEnter….standardization."

    "text": "Standardization\nAny normal curve can be transformed into a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0, and a SD of 1. We use this information to do two things:\n\nWe express the difference between any score in a distribution and the mean in terms of standard scores, also known as Z scores.\nThen, we use Z scores to determine the proportion of cases between the mean and any Z score.\n\n\n\nCheck out this video to get a more detailed explanation of the usefulness of standardization [11 minutes].\n\n\nRaw score into Z scores\nAn observation (or raw score) can be standardized by transforming it into a Z score, a standardized measure of how many standard deviations the observation is above or below the mean.\n\nZ SCORE\nThe number of standard deviations that a given raw score (or the observed score) is above or below the mean.\n\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\nSocial scientists use Z scores when they want to standardize the data, either due to its distribution or to make a comparison between variables with different scales. Z scores are a standardized measure of how much below or above the mean a specific value (raw score) is in a given dataset.\nWhen a raw score is above the mean, the Z score will always be positive. When a raw score is below the mean, the Z score will always be negative.\nWatch this short video to get an overview of how to turn a value into a Z score [2 minutes].\n\n\nLet’s try it out by returning to our example of women’s ideal age of marriage.\n\nThink Like a Statistician:\nWhat proportion of women think the ideal age of marriage is 29 or younger?\n\nOur first step is to turn our observation (29) into a Z score, using the given mean (26.19) and standard deviation (2.07).\n\nPlug our numbers into the formula:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{29 - 26.19}{2.07} = 1.36\n\\]\nNice! The math isn’t really the hard part here, but rather it is knowing which numbers go where in the formula.\nYou can also use an online Z score calculator. But, you’ll still need to know which numbers correlate with which symbol.\nAlright, now we know that a value of 29 is 1.36 standard deviations above the mean. But, we still need to convert this Z score into a meaningful percentage.\n\n\nZ scores into proportions\nTo turn our Z score into a more interpretable proportion or percentage, we use something called a “Standard Normal Distribution Table.”\n\nCheck out this video for instructions on using a Standard Normal Distribution Table [~7 minutes].\n\n\nLet’s apply these skills to our example. Our Z score was 1.36. You can use a Standard Normal Distribution Table found online, like this Standard Normal Distribution Table.\nThe advantage of an online tool is you can use the slider in order to find the area of the curve that matches your Z score.\n\nNotice that I dragged the slider until the Z score matched 1.36. The interactive normal distribution automatically shows me that this area contains 41.31% of the area between the mean and a Z score of 1.36.\nIt’s a good practice to verify your results by checking the table.\n\nUsing the table, we find the proportion equal to a Z score of 1.36 = .4131. Great! This matches the percentage determined by using the slider.\nDoes this mean that the answer to our question, what proportion of women who think the ideal age of marriage is 29 or younger, is 41.31%?\nNot exactly.\nLook back at the shaded area of the picture. This proportion tells us the area under the curve between the mean and our Z score. So, we could say that 41.31% of women think the ideal age of marriage is between 26 (the mean) and 29.\nBut, if we want to identify the proportion of women who think the ideal age of marriage is age 29 or younger, we need to account for the 50% of women who think the ideal age of marriage is younger than 26 (the mean).\nWe can determine that the:\n\narea to the left of the mean is \\(.5\\).\n\narea between the mean and our Z score is \\(.4131\\).\n\nAdd these together:\n\\(.5 + .4131 = .9131\\)\n\nYour Data Take!\n91.31% of women think the ideal age of marriage is age 29 or younger.\n\nYou can check your answer by adjusting the settings on the slider of the normal curve. Instead of showing us the proportion from 0 (the standard mean) to our Z score, click the button to select “Up to Z” to see the new results.\n\nDo you know how to change the slider to show you the percentage of women who think the ideal age of marriage is older than age 29?\nIt would be even simpler to use . We simply use the pnorm() function.\n PRACTICE:\n\nUse the pnorm() function to calculate our Z score (1.36).\nThen, click “Run Code” to see your results.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your answer, click “Submit Answer.”\n\n\n\npnorm(______)\n\n\n\n\n\npnorm(1.36)\n\n\n\nHint: Did you replace the blank line with our Z score: 1.36?\n\n\n\nTransform a proportion (area) into a Z score\nWe can also work backwards. If we have a percentage, we can use the table to find a Z score. This was mentioned briefly in the last video, but check out this video for a more comprehensive explanation [~9 minutes].\n\n\n\nHeads up!\nBe aware that the logic varies slightly, depending on whether the table used provides only positive Z scores, or both positive and negative Z scores."

    "text": "Sampling Distributions\nA population is a group including all the cases (e.g., individuals, cities, etc.) the researcher is interested in. A sample is a smaller subset of cases drawn from the population.\n\nPARAMETER\nA measure (e.g., mean or standard deviation) used to describe a population distribution.\n\n\nSTATISTIC\nA measure (e.g., mean or standard deviation) used to describe a sample distribution.\n\nPopulation parameters are generally unknown, but we can try to estimate them using sample statistics.\n\nIn order to make inferences about the general population, we must collect a random sample.\n\n\nSampling Error\n\nSAMPLING ERROR\nThe discrepancy between a sample estimate of a population parameter and the real population parameter.\n\nWe typically rely on samples to estimate the true parameters of the population of interest. But, there is usually a difference between a sample estimate of a population parameter (i.e., a statistic) and the real population parameter.\nFor example, if the true mean height of students in our class (the population) is 5’ 7”, but the mean height found in our sample is 5’ 9”, then the sampling error is 2 inches.\n\n PRACTICE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling Distributions\n\nSAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\nA theoretical probability distribution of all possible sample values for the statistic in which we are interested.\n\nIf we drew all possible random samples (all the same size sample) from our population of interest, computed the statistic of interest for each sample, and plotted the frequency distribution of that statistic, we would be plotting a sampling distribution.\nFor example, we could draw a sample of 10 students in a 100 person class and calculate their mean study hours per week. Then, we could draw another sample of 10 students and calculate their mean study hours. We could do this over and over and over again until we conducted every single possible random sample of 10 students in the 100 person class and calculate every mean. Then, we could make a frequency plot of all the means.\nThe distribution plot of means of all of our samples – DISTRIBUTION OF SAMPLE MEANS – would be approximately normally distributed.\n\nAs long as our samples are random, the distributions of sample means are normally distributed, even when populations aren’t.\n\nIf our sample is not random, we cannot be sure our sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed.\n\nFUN FACTS:\n\nYou can have a sampling distribution for any type of statistic (mean, proportion, variance, etc.)\nA sampling distribution has a mean and a standard deviation.\n\n\nA sampling distribution (of means), like all distributions, has a mean and a standard deviation.\n\nIts mean is the same as the true population mean!\nIts standard deviation is known as the standard error.\n\n\nStandard Error\n\nSTANDARD ERROR OF THE MEAN\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.\n\nThe standard error of the mean describes how much dispersion there is in the value of the mean from sample to sample.\nThe standard error of the mean is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.\nThe standard error of the mean (SEM) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{SEM} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- ( s ) is the sample standard deviation\n- ( n ) is the sample size\n\nNotation\nNote, the notation would change in the formula if we’re referring to the population distribution, rather than a sample.\nThe standard error of the mean (SEM), when using population parameters, is defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- ( ) is the population standard deviation\n- ( N ) is the population size\n\n\nWatch this short video about how to calculate the standard error of the mean [~4 minutes].\n\n\n PRACTICE:\nThe standard deviation of work hours per week in the population is \\(14.69\\).\nWhat is the standard error of the population distribution of the mean, if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance of the Sampling Distribution\nThe sampling distribution is used to support the use of samples to estimate the true parameters of the population.\nAlso allows us to know how much our estimate will vary from the “true” result.\n\nHow much confidence can we place in our results?\n\n\n\n\nSample Size\nIf all possible random samples of size N are drawn from a population, as N becomes larger, the sampling distribution of sample means becomes approximately normal.\nWith a sufficient sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.\nIf the population distribution is approximately normal, a sample of 30 or more will be sufficient.\nWith 50 or more observations in a sample, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\n\nProbability Sampling\nA method of sampling where the researcher specifies the probability of being sampled for every member of the population.\nFor example, if I were to randomly select one student from a University of Toronto lecture with 120 attendees, each student would have a 1 in 120 chance (or approximately 0.0083 probability) of being selected.\nKnowing the probability of being sampled allows us to make inferences about the population based on probability theory.\n\nHeads Up!\nIf you assign a 0.1 probability to each of 15 students being selected, you’d end up with a total probability of 1.5. That’s a red flag—probabilities must sum to 1 or less in any valid scenario. It’s like saying there’s a 150% chance of something happening… which is great for optimism, but not for math.\n\n\nSimple random sample:\nEvery member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen and every combination of N members has an equal chance of being chosen.\nSuppose there are 100 students in a University of Toronto class, and you want to randomly select 10 students for a survey.\nRun this code a couple of time to see the different samples.\n\n\n# Create a population of 100 students\nstudents &lt;- paste(\"Student\", 1:100)\n\n# Select 10 students without replacement (i.e., no duplicates).\nsample(students, size = 10, replace = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nSystematic random sample:\nRandom sampling where every Kth case is chosen.\n\nthe first member of the sample is selected at random\nevery Kth member thereafter is also chosen\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{\\text{Population Size}}{\\text{Sample Size}}\n\\]\nEvery member has equal chance of selection, but every combination of members does not.\nRun this code a couple of time to see the different samples.\n\n\n# Create a population of 100 students\nstudents &lt;- paste(\"Student\", 1:100)\n\n# Calculate sampling interval (k)\nk &lt;- length(students) / 10  # 10 is our desired sample size\n\n# Randomly select a starting point between 1 and k\nstart &lt;- sample(1:k, 1)\n\n# Generate the indices for the systematic sample\nsample_indices &lt;- seq(from = start, by = k, length.out = 10)\n\n# Select students using the indices\nsystematic_sample &lt;- students[sample_indices]\n\n# Display the sampled students\nprint(systematic_sample)\n\n\n\n\nStratified random sample:\nPopulation is divided (or stratified) into groups, and random samples are drawn from each group. There are two types of stratified random samples:\nProportionate stratified sampling:\nSize of each group’s sample is proportional to the group’s size in the population\nDisproportionate stratified sampling:\nSize of each group’s sample is not proportional to its size in the population Involves “oversampling” of 1 or more groups\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nThe sampling distribution is used to support the use of samples to estimate the true parameters of the population. Sampling distributions allow us to make comparisons between different groups, even when the underlying distribution of the population being studied is unknown.\nThey help us know how much our estimate will vary from the “true” result. In other words, sampling distributions help us answer the question, “How much confidence can we place in our results?”\nSampling distributions are theoretical. By using the Central Limit Theorem, we can compare our sample statistic with the sampling distribution in order to estimate how unlikely it is that our sample mean deviates from the actual population mean.\nIn order to make use of the central limit theorem, our sample size has to be large enough (50 or more) and it has to be random: each person must have an equal probability of being selected for the sample.\n\n\nSimulation\nLet’s see how this works using the agekdbrn variable. (I’ve already removed missing values and limited the dataset to 2022 respondents.)\nTo take a random sample of people’s ages when they had their first child, we can use the sample() function. The function needs two pieces of information: 1) the variable we want to sample and 2) the number of people we want to sample. We’ll start with a random sample of 50 people and store our values as an object called “sample1.”\nBecause the sample() function will take a random sample, the sample will be different every time you run the code.\nRun the code a few times before submitting your answer. Notice that the numbers are different each time, but pay attention to how the mean changes.\n\nUse the sample() function to generate a random sample for the variable agekdbrn.\nTell  you want to know the mean of your random sample (sample1).\nThen, click “Run Code” to see your results.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your answer, click “Submit Answer.”\n\n\n\nsample1 &lt;- sample(gss_all$_____, 50)\nsample1 \nmean(_______) # Look at the mean of your random sample of 50 respondents\n\n\n\n\n\nsample1 &lt;- sample(gss_all$agekdbrn, 50)\nsample1 \nmean(sample1) # Look at the mean of your random sample of 50 respondents\n\n\n\n\nsample1 &lt;- sample(gss_all$agekdbrn, 50)\nsample1 \nmean(_______) # Look at the mean of your random sample of 50 respondents\n\n\n\n\nsample1 &lt;- sample(gss_all$agekdbrn, 50)\nsample1 \nmean(sample1) # Look at the mean of your random sample of 50 respondents\n\n\nIf we take enough samples, the distribution of our sample means will stack up close to 25 (our full sample mean), and approximate a normal distribution. To illustrate, we will calculate a mean for 100 random samples of 50 respondents and then plot the means in a histogram. You don’t need to understand this code, but what it is doing is generating 100 samples of 50 randomly selected respondents, storing each sample of 50 respondents’ ages at the time their first child was born, and then calculating 100 means (1 mean for each sample). Then, geom_histogram() will plot every sample mean.\nRun the code below a few times to see how the distribution of sample means changes each time you draw 100 new samples.\n\n\nagekdbrn.sample &lt;- as.data.frame(t(replicate(100, sample(gss_all$agekdbrn, 50))))\n\nagekdbrn.sample$mean &lt;- rowMeans(agekdbrn.sample, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nggplot(agekdbrn.sample, aes(x=mean)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n\n\n\nWe can also calculate the standard deviation of our sample means, which is referred to as the standard error of the mean. To do so, we divide the standard deviation for the population (6.43) by the square root for the sample size (100).\n\nReplace the blank line in the code below with the sample size.\nThen, click “Run Code” to see your results.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your answer, click “Submit Answer.”\n\n\n\nsd(gss_all$agekdbrn)/sqrt(___)\n\n\n\n\nHint: Did you replace the blank line with the sample size 100?\n\n\n\nsd(gss_all$agekdbrn)/sqrt(100)\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can apply the 68-95-99.7 rule.\nRoughly 95% of observations in a normal distribution occur between the mean and ±2 standard deviations.\nIf we took enough samples (with a large enough sample size), we’d expect the average of our sample means to be close to the full sample mean of 24. And, we would expect 95% of our sample means to fall within ±2 standard deviations of 24.90:\n\nAdd to the code below to calculate 2 standard deviations above the mean of 24.9 using the standard error (.63).\nThen, click “Run Code” to see your results.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your answer, click “Submit Answer.”\n\n\n\n#Lower bound\n24.90-(2*.63)\n#Upper bound\n\n\n\n\n\n#Lower bound\n24.90-(2*.63)\n#Upper bound\n24.90+(_____)\n\n\n\n\n#Lower bound\n24.90-(2*.63)\n#Upper bound\n24.90+(2*.63)\n\n\nSo, how likely is it that a random sample of 100 people would be 35, on average, at the time of their first child’s birth? We could calculate it:\n(35-24.90)/0.63 = 16.03\nNot very likely. That’s 16 standard errors above the mean. Not impossible (weird things happen) but it is extremely unlikely.\n\n\nWatch this review video explaining how all of these terms and ideas fit together [12 minutes]."

It is arguably the most commonly used measure of central tendency.\n\n\nMEAN\nThe arithmetic average obtained by adding up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate it, add all of the observations together, and divide by the number of observations.\nFinding the mean in a list:\n\\(7, 4, 2, 8, 0, 9, 5\\)\n\nAdd all observations together: \\(7 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 0 + 9 + 5 = 35\\)\nDivide the sum by the number of observations: \\(\\frac{35}{7} = 5\\)\n\n\nIt’s weakness is that it is sensitive to outliers, extreme scores in a distribution.\n\nOUTLIERS\nValues that are much lower or much greater than the rest of the values in a dataset.\n\n\nPretend the following values are annual incomes for 10 families:\n\n\n\nFamily ID\nAnnual Income (CAD)\n\n\n\n\nF01\n$48,000\n\n\nF02\n$52,000\n\n\nF03\n$45,000\n\n\nF04\n$50,000\n\n\nF05\n$53,000\n\n\nF06\n$49,000\n\n\nF07\n$46,000\n\n\nF08\n$51,000\n\n\nF09\n$65,000\n\n\nF10\n$250,000\n\n\n\nSource: Totally fake data\n\n PRACTICE:\nLet’s use R to calculate the average.\n\nClick the Run Code button below.\n\nThen, click Submit Answer.\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(48000, 52000, 45000, 50000, 53000, \n             49000, 46000, 51000, 65000, 250000)\n\n# Use the mean function\nmean(my_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(48000, 52000, 45000, 50000, 53000, \n             49000, 46000, 51000, 65000, 250000)\n\n# Use the mean function\nmean(my_data)\n\n\n\nHint: Just push the Run Code button to see the output.\n\n\n\nMost families in this sample earn between $45K–53K, but one high-income household pushes the average far above what’s typical: $70,900\n\nDoes this seem like an accurate representation of the typical annual income of these families?

About half of the families have an income below the mean, and half have an income above the mean.\nTo summarize, averages are easy to calculate but they can also be misleading.\n\nMeans are often depicted as line graphs, as seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\nMedian\nThe median is the middlemost point of your data.\n\nMEDIAN\nThe score that divides the distribution into two equal halves.\n\n\n\n\nFinding the median in a list with an odd number of observations:\n\\(7, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2\\)\n\nPut the list in order: \\(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\)\n\nPick the center number: \\(3\\)\n\n\nFinding the median in a list with an even number of observations:\n\\(2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1\\)\n\nPut the list in order: \\(0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5\\)\n\nAdd the two center numbers & divide by 2: \\(\\frac{1 + 2}{2} = 1.5\\)\n\nThe median is the value at the 50th percentile in a cumulative frequency distribution. (This is typically an easier way to find the median than counting individual observations.)\n\n\nPERCENTILE\nA score below which a specific percentage of the distribution falls.\n\nIf you score at the 25th percentile on a test, then 25% of the class did worse than you and 75% of the class did better.\nIf you score at the 90th percentile on a test, then 90% of the class did worse than you and 10% of the class did better.\nA distribution is sometimes divided up into quarters: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

If I asked you your favorite ice cream flavor and 3 people said vanilla, 4 people said chocolate, and 17 people said mint-chocolate chip, the mode would be “mint-chocolate chip.”\n\nMODE\nCategory or score with the highest frequency (or percentage) in a distribution.\n\n\nFinding the mode in a list:\n\\(7, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2\\)\n\nPut the list in order: \\(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\\)\nPick the most frequent number: \\(1\\)\n\nThe number 1 appears 3 times in the list, more than any other number. That makes it the mode.\n PRACTICE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\nIn R, mean() and median() are standard functions which do what you’d expect. mode() tells you the internal storage mode of the object, not the value that occurs the most.\n\n\n\n\nFinding the mode in a table\nThe mode can also be identified in a table. The mode is the category with the greatest frequency or the largest percentage.\nPercentage distribution of opinion on whether people are helpful or look out for themselves\n\nSurvey question: Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful, or that they are mostly just looking out for themselves?\n \n\nNow, let’s try it by creating a frequency table in R and then finding the mode.\n PRACTICE:\n\nReplace the blank line with fairearn.\nClick the Run Code button to create a relative frequency table.\nWhen you’re satisfied with your code, click Submit Answer.\n\n\n\nfreq(gss_all$________, report.nas = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\nfreq(gss_all$fairearn, report.nas = FALSE) \n\n\n\nHint: Did you type fairearn in place of the blank line?\n\nSurvey question: How fair is what you earn on your job in comparison to others doing the same type of work you do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBimodal:\nA “bimodal distribution” has two distinct humps, even if the peaks aren’t exactly the same height.\n\n\nBIMODAL\nTwo values or categories with the highest frequency.\n\n\nTake a look at the figure below. It shows the distributions for daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people for Canada and the U.S.\n\n\n\nWe could identify the modal number of deaths to be around 10 deaths per million people in the U.S., occurring sometime in January of 2021.\nFor Canada, the mode occurs in May of 2020 at about 4.49 death per million Canadians.\nIf we only reported those modes and dates, it would seem like the most fatalities in the two countries occurred at wildly different times.\nHowever, the graph makes it obvious that there were actually two peaks, occurring around the same time, in both countries: one in the spring of 2020 and one in the winter of 2021.\nThese distributions are examples of a bi-modal distribution: there are essentially two peaks (for each country).\n\n\n PRACTICE:\nUsing the figure below to answer the following practice question.\nThese figure shows distributions of reviews for a variety of movies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a Measure\nAn appropriate measure of central tendency depends on three factors:\n\nthe way the variables are measured (i.e., the level of measurement)\n\nthe shape of the distribution\n\nthe purpose of the research\n\nThe MODE is appropriate for nominal and ordinal variables.\nIt can be identified for interval-ratio level variables, but is often not useful.\nThe MEDIAN is appropriate for interval-ratio and ordinal variables.\nIt cannot be used for nominal level variables.\nThe MEAN can ONLY be determined for interval-ratio variables.\n\n\nDistributions\nLet’s make sure you’ve got the differences between the mean, median, and mode. And why they are important to know. Check out this video [11 minutes].\n\n\nWhen the mean, median, and mode are all equal to one another, we say that the distribution is symmetrical.\n\nThe mean is a good measure of central tendency for a symmetrical distribution.\nBut, the mean can be skewed by very high or very low numbers. The mean is a less suitable measure of central tendency in distributions with extreme values on one side.\n\n\nPositively Skewed Distribution\n\n\n\nHeads up!\nWhen a distribution is positively skewed, the mean is greater than the median.\n\n\n\nNegatively Skewed Distribution\n\n\n\n\nHeads up!\nWhen a distribution is negatively skewed, the mean is less than the median.\n\n\n\n PRACTICE:\nWhat is the best measure of central tendency for each of the following?\nHINT: Identify the type of variable first. Then decide which measure is appropriate."

    "text": "Measures of Variability\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to calculate measures of variability, values that describe the diversity in a distribution, for interval-ratio (aka continuous) variables. Measures of variability reveal how spread out the values in your dataset are.\nWatch this short video explaining why we need measures of variability in addition to our measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) [~11 minutes]. WARNING: MATH AHEAD!\n\n\n\nRange\n\nRANGE\nThe difference between the highest and lowest values in a distribution.\n\n\nHere’s a short video showing you how to calculate the range [~3 minutes]. \n\nFinding the range in a list:\nWomen’s ideal age of marriage:\n\\(26,  23,  28,  27,  24,  25,  32,  25,  28,  25,  25,  26,  27,  26,  27,  25\\)\n\nPut the list in order: \\({\\color{mathBlue} 23}, 24, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 26, 26, 26, 27, 27, 27, 28, 28, {\\color{mathRed} 32}\\)\nSubtract the min from the max: \\({\\color{mathRed} 32} - {\\color{mathBlue} 23} = 9\\)\n\n\nWhat about using R to do the calculations for us?

Check out this video for a demonstration on calculating the quartiles [~6 minutes].\n\n\nNow that you know what the quartiles are, you can use this information to calculate the IQR. To do so, you simply subtract Q1 from Q3.\n\nIQR in a list with an odd number of observations:\n\\(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\)\n\nQ1 is the median of the numbers below the median: \\({\\color{mathOrange} 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6,} {\\color{mathBlue} 7},\n7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\) (\\(\\frac{3 + 4}{2}\\)) \\(= {\\color{mathOrange} 3.5}\\)\n\nQ3 is the median of the numbers above the median: \\(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, {\\color{mathBlue} 7},\n{\\color{mathRed}7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12}\\) (\\(\\frac{8 + 9}{2}\\)) \\(= {\\color{mathRed} 8.5}\\)\n\nSubtract Q1 from Q3: \\({\\color{mathRed} 8.5} - {\\color{mathOrange} 3.5} = 5\\)\n\n\nIQR in a list with an even number of observations:\n\\(3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13\\)\n\nQ1 is the median of the numbers below the median: \\({\\color{mathOrange} 3, 4, 5, 7, }\n9, 10, 11, 13\\) (\\(\\frac{4 + 5}{2}\\)) \\(= {\\color{mathOrange} 4.5}\\)\n\nQ3 is the median of the numbers above the median: \\(3, 4, 5, 7,\n{\\color{mathRed}9, 10, 11, 13}\\) (\\(\\frac{10 + 11}{2}\\)) \\(= {\\color{mathRed} 10.5}\\)\n\nSubtract Q1 from Q3: \\({\\color{mathRed} 10.5} - {\\color{mathOrange} 4.5} = 6\\)\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe median of the list is \\(8\\).\n\n\nWhat about using R to do the calculations for us? We can use the quantile() function to get the minx, Q1, Q2 (median), Q3, and Q4 (max). IQR() function will simply repot the IQR.\nBut, there’s a catch! The iqr() function is simple, but there are actually 9 different ways that R can calculate the IQR! Yikes!\nTo match our calculations:\n\nodd number of observations = type 6\neven number of observations = type 5\n\nTry it out on our fake data and see if you can match our hand calculations.\n PRACTICE:\n\nReplace the blank line with the correct type number.\nClick the Run Code button.\nWhen you’re satisfied with your code, click Submit Answer.\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12)\n\n# Choose the correct type and then use the IQR function on my_data\nquantile(my_data, type = _)\nIQR(my_data, type = _)\n\n\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12)\n\n# Choose the correct type and then use the IQR function on my_data\nquantile(my_data, type = 6)\nIQR(my_data, type = 6)\n\n\n\nHint: Delete the blank lines and type “6” (without the quotes).\n\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13)\n\n# Choose the correct type and then use the IQR and quantile functions on my_data\nquantile(my_data, type = _)\nIQR(my_data, type = _)\n\n\n\n\n\n# store the values in an object called my_data\nmy_data &lt;- c(3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13)\n\n# Choose the correct type and then use the IQR and quantile functions on my_data\nquantile(my_data, type = 5)\nIQR(my_data, type = 5)\n\n\n\nHint: Delete the blank lines and type “5” (without the quotes).\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation\nA key measure of spread in statistics is the standard deviation.\n\nSTANDARD DEVIATION\nA measure of variation for interval-ratio variables.\n\n\nAlong the way to calculating the standard deviation, you calculate the variance of a distribution. The variance is also a measure of variation of a distribution, but it is difficult to interpret because the number doesn’t reflect interpretable units.\nTherefore, most of the time we continue on in our calculations to determine the standard deviation. The standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the observations. Meaning, if our variable is age, the standard deviation will be expressed in years. If our variable is income, the standard deviation will be expressed in dollars.\nIf all of the values in a distribution are identical, the standard deviation would be equal to zero. The mean, median, and mode would all be the same value, as there would be no variation between the values. For example, let’s say I asked a sample of 30 students how many hours they spent watching Netflix last week, and everyone reported 10 hours. The mean, median, and mode would all be 10. The standard deviation would be zero because there was no variation in the answers.\nNow, let’s say I asked these same 30 students this question the following week. They all mostly reported 10 hours of Netflix viewing this week too. Except, this week, one person reported zero hours because they canceled their Netflix account and one person was home sick for the week and reported 20 hours of Netflix viewing. The mean, median, and mode would remain 10 hours per week. But, the standard deviation would be larger than zero because there was variation in the reported hours. The larger the standard deviation, the more variation there is in a distribution (i.e., values in a dataset).\n\n5 steps for calculating the standard deviation.\n\nCalculate the mean.\nSubtract the mean from every value (deviation from the mean).\nSquare each “deviation from the mean.”\nCalculate the mean of the squared “deviations from the mean.”\nTake the square root of this new mean!\n\n\nHeads Up!\nThe mean of the squared “deviations from the mean” is the variance!\n\n\nDid I lose you there? Watch this video for a demonstration [4 minutes]. Here’s where the real math comes in!\n\n\nNote the end of the video mentions there are two formula’s for calculating the standard deviation (and variance). Technically, instead of summing the “squared deviations from the mean” and dividing the sum from the total number of observations, when using a sample, statisticians divide by the total number of observations minus one.\nOnce the sample sizes become large enough, there’s a negligible difference between the two. In this course, we’re not going to worry about the difference. Always use the population variance and standard deviation equations, if asked to calculate by hand.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nOkay, now that you know how to calculate the standard deviation, why would you want to?\nWatch this video for the explanation for why this is a useful skill in statistics [4 minutes].\n\nThe interpretation of a standard deviation requires knowing the mean. Then, you can say something like this:\nI expect the average [whatever you're studying] to differ by [your standard deviation] from the mean.\nFor example, if the average number of minutes watching television per day was 250 and the standard deviation was 90, you could say:\nI expect the average number of minutes of television watched per day to differ by 90 minutes from the mean (250 minutes).\n\nLet’s see this in action\n\\(2,3,4,7,9\\)\n\n\n\nStep 1 Calculate the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 7 +9}{5} = 5\\)\n\n\n\nStep 2 Subtract the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) from every value (\\(X\\))\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 Square each difference\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 Calculate the mean of the squares\n\n\\(\\frac{9 + 4 +1 + 4 +16}{5} = 6.8\\)\n\n\n\nHeads Up!\n6.8 is known as the variance!\n\n\n\nStep 5 Take the square root of the variance\n\\(\\sqrt{6.8} = 2.6\\)\nI expect the average [whatever you’re studying] to differ by [your standard deviation] from the mean.\n\nExample: Mean: 5; SD: 2.6\n\nI expect the average [number of household family members] to differ by [2.6 people] from the mean [of 5 people per household].\n\n\nWow, this is going to get tedious with any more cases. Let’s make R do this for us instead.
