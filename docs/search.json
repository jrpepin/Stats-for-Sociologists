Homework assignments will include a mixture of conceptual and applied (computational) questions; in the latter case, directions will specify whether calculations should be done by hand or using R. Each homework will be weighted equally.\nAssignments are due by the beginning of class on the specified date. They should be uploaded to the designated spot on Quercus (NOT emailed to your professor or TA). Show your work, round numbers appropriately (when doing calculations retain at least four decimal places; when presenting your final answer, round to two decimal places), and be neat and organized.\nYou may work together in small groups on homework assignments. Remember, however, that working through the homework is the best preparation for the exam and a measure of your understanding of course material. Even if you work with others, you must write up and turn in your own homework."

Are there any other possible interpretations? What limitations might there be in your data or analysis that affect how well we can answer the question?\n\nDetails on the research brief, including choice of datasets, will be given at a later date.\nNOTE: To keep you on track and to provide feedback along the way, you will submit Table 01 (including your research question and data section) earlier in the semester (5%).

However, a due date for a milestone assignment can be extended for a legitimate reason with proper documentation (e.g., illness, family emergency, religious observance, accessibility accommodation) according to UofT’s guidelines. Late Research Briefs will be penalized at a rate of 2% per day up to 10% (5 days) and will not be accepted thereafter, except where there are legitimate, documented reasons beyond a student’s control. Flash Presentations, given their in class participatory nature, cannot be extended.\nNote: Extensions beyond the term end date (not the last day of instruction but the actual end of term, e.g., the last day of a fall term class may be December 1st, but the term ends December 23rd) requires a discussion with the instructor and the graduate office, as well as completion of an SGS request for an extension of course work form. These forms will be considered by the graduate office and are not automatically approved."

    "text": "Plagiarism Detection\nTurnitin plagiarism detection software is integrated within Quercus. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site. I am not comfortable with the widespread use of this software, which effectively provides large quantities of student work to a for-profit company whose future business uses may include using it to train machine learning and AI tools. Consequently, none of the assignments for this course are set for automatic review by Turnitin. However, if I have reason to suspect plagiarism, I may use this tool to detect plagiarism.\nIf you object to your work being subject to review by Turnitin, add a comment when you submit your assignment. If I do find that we need to review your assignment for plagiarism and you have asked that I not use Turnitin, I will ask that you provide sufficient secondary material (e.g., reading notes, outlines of the paper, rough drafts of the final draft, etc.) to establish that the paper you submit is truly yours. If you cannot or decline to provide the requested documentation and do not consent to us using Turnitin for review, I will decline to mark the assignment.\nPlagiarism: Be careful to avoid plagiarism. It is a serious academic offense with serious penalties (see the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters). Do not present someone else’s ideas as your own. Give proper references to others’ ideas, and use quotation marks if you are quoting. When in doubt, err on the side of a reference. Turning in an old paper, or large parts thereof, for credit in a second (or third etc.) course, is considered an academic offense that results in students being referred off to the Office of Academic Integrity."

I encourage you to limit your use to technical coding support/reference, grammar/copy editing, and outlining. Be aware that AI tools are often wrong, overly generic, and lacking in critical nuance. My expectations for you are considerably higher than that. You will need to be more persuasive and creative at linking sociological research with empirical data, thinking critically, and making connections between data and theory than any of these tools. Over-reliance on AI will prevent you from learning the skills necessary to complete work at the level expected for this class. Students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit."

Technically, instead of summing the “squared deviations from the mean” and dividing the sum from the total number of observations, when using a sample, statisticians divide by the total number of observations minus one.\nOnce the sample sizes become large enough, there’s a negligible difference between the two. In this course, we’re not going to worry about the difference. Always use the population variance and standard deviation equations."
