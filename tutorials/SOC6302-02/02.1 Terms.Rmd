Statistics Vocabulary
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**I'm interested in sociology. Why do I have to learn about
statistics?**]{.shadows-text style="color: #F39C12; font-size: 150%;"}

Students often arrive in statistics classes wondering why they are
required to take this class. Watch [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhK-iEyXYA) for a summary of how
sociologists *do* sociology and how statistics fits into the bigger
picture [\~10 minutes].

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhK-iEyXYA)

<br>

Before we can analyze data, we need to identify the **unit of
analysis**: who or what is being studied. The unit of analysis can be
people, institutions, groups, things, countries, states, and so on.

Rarely do scientists have the time to study an entire population of
interest, so we usually take a sample.

::: my-def
#### POPULATION

All units of analysis (people, institutions, groups, etc.) in which the
researcher is interested.
:::

<br>

::: my-def
#### SAMPLE

A subset of people (or institutions, groups, etc.) selected from a
population.
:::

<br>

#### A note on notation:

[**N**]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to
**population** size

[***n***]{style="font-size: 200%; color: #E74C3C;"} refers to **sample**
size

<br>

::: my-tip
#### Heads Up!

The capitalization of the symbols/notations in statistics are
meaningful.
:::

Capital letters are typically used when describing a population.
Lowercase letters are often used when describing a sample.

![](images/pop-sample.png "Stick figures in a population selected for a sample."){width="50%"}

### 

### Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics

In this course, you will learn about descriptive and inferential
statistics. There are two types of statistics:

::: my-def
#### DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Procedures that help us organize and describe data collected from a
sample or population.
:::

<br>

::: my-def
#### INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

Making underlying predictions or inferences about a *population* using
observations and analyses from a *sample.*
:::

<br>

Watch this short [video](https://youtu.be/87rxkjYNHUk) for a more
detailed explanation of the difference between the two [3 minutes].

![](https://youtu.be/87rxkjYNHUk)

<br />

We will focus on descriptive statistics the first few weeks of the
course, before moving on to inferential statistics.

<br>

`r fa("otter", fill = "#F39C12")`<practice> PRACTICE:</practice>

*Indicate whether the following uses descriptive or inferential
statistics*

```{r P01, echo=FALSE}
  question("The number of Toronto residents who were homeless in 2024.",
         answer("Descriptive", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Inferential"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r P02, echo=FALSE}
  question("Determining students’ opinion about the quality of dining options at UofT based on a sample of 100 students.",
         answer("Inferential", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Descriptive", message = "Hint: The phrase 'based on' in the statement means _inferences_ are being made."),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Tidy Data

Quantitative researchers commonly analyze data stored in tables, where
data is recorded in a combination of rows and columns (*think*
spreadsheets).

[**Tidy
data**](https://medium.com/@prabhakar_p/importance-of-tidy-data-and-its-impact-on-data-analysis-22e2e5acd90d)
is a specific way of organizing data into a consistent format (how the
data is organized in rows and columns).

Tidy data files contain one line for each observation, such as a record
or person (also called a "respondent"). **Each column generally
represents a single variable.**

![](images/variable.png "Cartoon graph with a thought bubble saying 'Wait. What's a variable?'"){width="60%"}
<br />

::: my-def
#### VARIABLES

Any factor, trait, or condition that can exist in differing amounts or
types.
:::

Variables are attributes that describe a person, place, thing, or idea
that we can then measure. They can be thought of as characteristics that
*vary*.

Variables must be **mutually exclusive** (classify every observation)
and **exhaustive** (one category for each observation).

There are three rules that make a dataset tidy:

1.  Each variable must have its own column.
2.  Each observation must have its own row.
3.  Each value must have its own cell.

![](images/tidy-data.png "Three tables showing variables as columns, observations as rows, values in individual cells."){width="75%"}

<br />

To conduct statistical analyses, we need to know the scale of
measurement for a variable. There are different ways that variables can
be measured.

Consider how we might measure *happiness* in a survey.

People could tell us they either are happy or they are not happy. They
could tell us how happy they are, such as very unhappy, somewhat
unhappy, somewhat happy, or very happy. We could ask people to rate
their happiness on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being not at all happy and
10 being ecstatic! Or, we could ask people to tell us what emotion they
most felt throughout the day (e.g., happy, sad, content, joyful,
anxious, and so on).

These options are all different *levels of measurement*.

<br />

### Measurement Levels

**Watch this short
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZxnzfnt5v8){target="_blank"}
explaining the different types of data that scientists collect [\~6
minutes].**

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZxnzfnt5v8)

#### **Terms**

[**DICHOTOMOUS** (aka binary)]{style="color: #18BC9C;"} A variable with
only two categories.

[**NOMINAL**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"}\
A variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to
rank.

[**ORDINAL**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"} A variable made up of ranked
categories, but there is no systematic and measurable numeric difference
between the categories.

[**INTERVAL-RATIO**]{style="color: #18BC9C;"} A variable with categories
that are rank-ordered and expressed in the same units.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Transforming Variables**

One kind of variable can be transformed into another kind of variable.
Properties that can be measured at a more precise level can also be
measured at a less precise level, but not vice versa.

<br />

[Example:]{style="color: #F39C12;"}\
Years of education, an interval variable, can be dichotomized into "high
school graduate" vs. "not a graduate."

![](images/levels.png "Cartoon examples of Nominal, Ordinal, and Binary variable types."){width="100%"}

<br /> `r fa("otter", fill = "#DB9C1B")`<practice> PRACTICE:</practice>

*Identify the following as nominal level, ordinal level, or
interval-ratio level data.*

```{r P03, echo=FALSE}
  question("Satisfaction rating (extremely dislike, dislike, neutral, like, extremely like)",
           answer("nominal", message = "Try again. These responses have a ranked order."),
           answer("ordinal", correct = TRUE, message = "Amazing!"),
           answer("interval-ratio", message = "Try again. The differences between adjacent categories do not necessarily have the same meaning."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

```{r P04, echo=FALSE}
  question("Amount of money in savings accounts",
           answer("interval-ratio", correct = TRUE, message = "Splendid!"),
           answer("nominal", message = "Try again. This isn't a variable made up of categories that cannot be ordered according to rank."),
           answer("ordinal",  message = "Try again. The difference between two values is meaningful."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

Frequency Distributions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once we've collected the data from a sample, we evaluate the responses. 
Are all the responses alike? Did people pick one answer category more than others? 
Are lots of people middle class or are some people very poor and some people really rich?  
  
To answer these questions, researchers analyze the *distribution* of the data.  
  
::: my-def
#### DISTRIBUTION:
Shows all the possible values (or intervals) of the data and how often they occur.
:::

<br>
  
::: my-def
#### FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION

A table reporting the number of observations falling into each category
of the variable.
:::

<br>

![](images/distributions.png "Three graphs with different frequency distributions."){ width=100% }

<br />    

#### Distribution Tables

A common first step in data analysis is to create a table showing the number of observations for each value of a variable. This is called a **frequency table**. 
It consists of two columns.  
  
The first column includes the variable and the response categories.  

The second column reports the number of cases in each category, 
as well as the total number of cases (i.e., sum of all frequencies).  

<br>

**Table 01. Attitudes about sex before marriage**

```{r}
#| label: table01
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

gss24$premarsx <- zap_missing(gss24$premarsx) 
gss24$premarsx <- as_factor(gss24$premarsx)
gss24$premarsx <- droplevels(gss24$premarsx)

freq_premarsx <- gss24 |>
  select(sex, premarsx) |>
  filter(!is.na(premarsx)) |>
  count(premarsx)

total_row <- freq_premarsx|>
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) |>
  mutate(premarsx = "Total")

# combine
table_premarsx <- rbind(freq_premarsx, total_row)

# Render the table
table_premarsx %>%
  flextable() %>%
  style_flextable()

# [Source: U.S. General Social Survey, 2024]{style="color: #grey80; font-size: 80%"}
```

![](images/table01.png "Table 01. Attitudes about sex before marriage."){ width=100% }


[**Survey question**: *There's been a lot of discussion about the way
morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.*]{style="font-size: 80%"}

<br>

Frequency tables are important for understanding data, but sometimes they can be misleading if the frequencies aren't considered in context. 

Let's look at an example.  

::: my-think
#### Think Like a Statistician:
Are women more likely than men to say premarital sex is "*not wrong at all*"?
:::

<br>

We start by looking at the frequency table that shows men and women's number of responses for each category.

**Table 02. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender**

```{r}
#| label: table02
#| echo: false

gss_all$premarsx <- as_factor(zap_missing(gss_all$premarsx))
gss_all$sex <- as_factor(zap_missing(gss_all$sex))

freq_premarsx <- gss_all %>%
  select(sex, premarsx) %>%
  filter(!is.na(premarsx), !is.na(sex)) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  count(premarsx) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n,
    values_fill = 0
  )

# create total row
total_row <- freq_premarsx %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>%
  mutate(premarsx = "Total") %>%
  select(names(freq_premarsx)) # ensure column order matches

# combine
table_premarsx <- rbind(freq_premarsx, total_row)

# Get number of rows
n_rows <- nrow(table_premarsx) # fixing transparency

# Render the table
table_premarsx %>%
  flextable() %>%
  style_flextable() %>%
  # Manually add zebra stripes with solid colors w/o transparency
  bg(i = seq(1, n_rows, by = 2), bg = "white", part = "body") %>%
  bg(i = seq(2, n_rows, by = 2), bg = "#F2F2F2", part = "body")
```

[Source: U.S. General Social Survey, 1972-2024]{style="color: #grey80; font-size: 80%"}

<br>

The table shows that 10,672 men and 11,086 women in the survey stated sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all.'  

If 414 more women than men thought premarital sex was "not wrong at all", 
why can't we conclude that women are more likely than men to think sex before marriage is '*not wrong at all*?' 

###

### Relative Frequency Distributions

Examine the table again to see the total number of men and women in the sample. 
More women than men answered the survey, which we didn't consider when comparing the frequencies alone.

::: my-def
#### RELATIVE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION

A table showing the proportion or percentage for each value of a
variable.
:::

To account for the greater number of women than men in our sample, we use a 'relative frequency distribution,' showing either proportions or percentages to make our comparison. 

[**Proportions**]{style="font-size: 125%"} are between 0 and 1.0.

$Proportion = \frac{f}{n}$

[**Percentages**]{style="font-size: 125%"} are between 0 and 100.

$Percentage = proportion × 100.$

In our table, we need two numbers to make the calculations.  

1.   The count of men who said sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all' (f = 10,672)  
2.   The total number of men who answered the survey question (n = 20,234)
  
  
$\frac{10,672}{20,234} = .53$

This is the proportion of men who said sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all.'  
  
It's often easier to talk about these numbers in percentages. So, we just multiply the proportion (.53) by 100.  

**53% of men said sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all.'**  

Let's use R as a calculator to do the same thing for women.

Click the `Run Code` button below.

```{r calc, exercise=TRUE}
(11086/25382)*100
```

```{r calc-solution}
(11086/25382)*100
```

<div id="calc-hint">
**HINT:** Just push the `Run Code` button to see the output.
</div>
<br />

In other words, **44% of women said sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all.'**
  
<br>

When do the same calculation for each category for both men and women, 
we can display these numbers in a **frequency table**. 

**Table 03. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender**  

```{r}
#| label: table03
#| echo: false

gss_all$premarsx <- droplevels(gss_all$premarsx)

# Create frequency & proportions table
tab <- gss_all %>%
  filter(!is.na(premarsx), !is.na(sex)) %>%
  group_by(sex, premarsx) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 0)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex, values_from = c(n, percent)
  )

# Add totals row
tab_totals <- tab %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  mutate(premarsx = "Total")

# Combine with original table
tab_with_totals <- bind_rows(tab, tab_totals)

## Pretty table
tab_with_totals %>%
  select(premarsx, n_male, percent_male, n_female, percent_female) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  style_flextable() %>%
  set_header_labels(
    n_male = "n", percent_male = "%",
    n_female = "n", percent_female = "%"
  ) %>%
  add_header_row(
    values = c("", "Men", "Women"),
    colwidths = c(1, 2, 2)
  ) %>%
  align(j = c(2, 3, 4, 5), align = "center", part = "all") %>%
  color(color = "#3498DB", i = 1, j = 3) |>
  color(color = "#3498DB", i = 2, j = 3) |>
  color(color = "#3498DB", i = 3, j = 3) |>
  color(color = "#3498DB", i = 4, j = 3) |>
  color(color = "#3498DB", i = 5, j = 3) |>
  bold(i = 5, j = 3, bold = TRUE)
```

[Source: U.S. General Social Survey, 1972-2024]{style="color: #grey80; font-size: 80%"}

::: my-tip
#### Heads Up!
Percentage columns ALWAYS sum to 100%. 

${21 + 7 + 19 + 53 = 100\%}$
:::

<br>

Let's review our findings: 53% of men but only 44% of women reported sex before marriage was 'not wrong at all.' 

::: my-take
#### Your Data Take!
A greater proportion of men (53%) than women (44%) say premarital sex is "*not wrong at all*."
:::

To summarize, in order to compare meaningfully across groups, a frequency should be converted into a
proportion or a percentage.

<br>

`r fa("otter", fill = "#F39C12")`<practice> PRACTICE:</practice>

```{r P05, echo=FALSE}
  question("According to Table 03, are men or women more likely to say sex before marriage is 'wrong only sometimes'?",
         answer("They are equally likely, about 19% of both men and women.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Men are more likely than women.",
                message = "Did you guess based on gender stereotypes? Base your opinion on the table."),
         answer("Women are more likely than men.",
                message = "There are more women than men in the sample, so you must look at the % column."),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


#### Working Backwards

You can also work backwards to **calculate a frequency** for a particular category if all you know is the percentage for the category and the total frequency.  
  
For example, if you know that 9% of women from a sample of 25,382 believe sex before marriage is 'almost always wrong,' you can calculate the number of women in this category. 

$proportion * total freq = freq$

Let's use R as a calculator to prove it to ourselves:


**Replace the blank line with x to calculate the frequency from the proportion.** 
Then, click the `Run Code` button below to confirm your results.

```{r prop, exercise=TRUE}
# Get the %
x <- 2388/25382

x # show x

# Get the freq
__ * 25382
```

```{r prop-solution}
# Get the %
x <- 2388/25382

x # show x

# Get the freq
x * 25382
```

<div id="prop-hint">
**HINT:** Did you replace __ with the letter 'x' (no quotes)?
</div>

<br />



### Cumulative Distributions  
  
There's one more distribution to know about.

::: my-def
#### Cumulative Distribution
A table showing the number or percentage of observations at or below a given category.
:::
  
<br> 

Sometimes researchers want to know the percentage of people in two or more categories.
These descriptions are displayed as cumulative distributions. 

Maybe we wanted to know the percentage of people who think premarital sex is always OR almost always wrong. We need to sum the percentages from each of the categories to get our answer.  

In 2024, 23% of people reported premarital sex is 'always' or 'almost always' wrong.

**Table 04. Attitudes about sex before marriage by gender**

### Rates  
  
Sometimes it makes sense to report frequencies as rates, rather than as proportions or percentages. 
Common rates sociologists might be interested in include the marriage rate, birth rate, or crime rate.

::: my-def
#### RATES

$\frac{Actual\;occurrences}{possible\;occurrences}$
:::    

<br>
  
Rates are often expressed per 1,000 or 100,000. (Calculate basic rate and multiply it by 1,000 or 100,000.)  

**Examples:**

-   [Canada's divorce
    rate](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220309/dq220309a-eng.htm)
    decreased from 12.7 per 1,000 in 1991 to 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020.\
-   The [2021 suicide
    rate](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/mental-health/suicide-self-harm/suicide-mortality.html)
    of 14.8 per 100,000 population for middle aged Canadians (30-59
    years old) was the highest of any age group.\
-   [Canada's total fertility
    rate](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/240925/dq240925c-eng.htm)
    reached a new low in 2023 of 1.26 children per woman.

<br>  
  
Rates can also be calculated for sub-groups.  
  
![](images/rates.png "Figure: Lifetime Risk of Being Killed by Police, per 100,000."){ width=90% }
  
  
As this chart shows, nearly 100 in 100,000 Black men and boys will be killed by U.S. police over the life course. Notice the different ways rates can be conveyed:  
  
1. Latino men and boys have an estimated risk of being killed by police of about 53 per 100,000.  
2. Asian/Pacific Islander men and boys face a lifetime risk of between 9 and 23 per 100,000.  
3. White men and boys face a lifetime risk of about 39 per 100,000.  
  
<br />

::: my-tip
#### Heads up!
The denominator must include all possible occurrences.  
:::
  
<br>
  
Can the divorce rate be calculated as follows?

$\frac{\text{Number couples divorcing in 2024}}{\text{Number couples marrying in 2024}}$

No! The *denominator* should consist of all couples who could divorce—including *every couple that is married* at any point in 2024, even if they got married before 2024.

### Figures

Sociologists want to understand data because it helps us understand the social world. Raw data,
like the distributions we have reviewed, are often presented as statistical graphs.
Graphing data helps people get the overall summary of a large amount of information quickly.  
  
Tables are especially good at conveying the details about the relationship between variables. 
But, graphs help direct attention to the take-away of the relationship, helping people
focus on the bigger picture rather than the details.

Let's consider some examples. Each of the graphs below could be presented as a table. 
But, the audience would have to work very hard to get the take-away point of the data from a table.

<br>

A [**bar graph**]{style="color: #18bc9c"} is used:\
for **nominal** or **ordinal** variables,

to show frequencies or percentages,

using separated rectangles, with height proportional\
to the frequency or percentage.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrpepin/Now-You-CanadaKnow/refs/heads/main/figs/transgender.png){width="100%"}

<br>

A [**histogram**]{style="color: #18bc9c"} is used:\
for **interval-ratio** variables,

to show frequencies or percentages,

using separated rectangles, with height proportional\
to the frequency or percentage.

![](images/histogram.png){width="100%"}

<br>

A [**line graph**]{style="color: #18bc9c"} is used:\
for **interval-ratio** variables,

to show frequencies or percentages,

joining by category the frequency or average with a line.

<br>

A [**statistical map**]{style="color: #18bc9c"} is used:\
for **interval-ratio** variables,

to show geographical variations, often in ratios,

using variation in color or hue.

Fifty Toronto couples were surveyed and asked to report the number of children under the age of 18 years in their household. The fifty families reported the following numbers of children: 

    0, 0, 1, 6, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 10, 7, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 9, 0, 2

**Create a table that displays the number, percentage, and cumulative percentage of families with each number of children.** 
You will need to create a table by hand or using a spreadsheet such as GoogleSheets or Excel. [Do NOT collapse any categories.]
